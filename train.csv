0;Плотник ослеп и впал в кому из-за занозы;"30-летний житель английского города Сент-Остелл, графство Корнуолл, Дэйв Паркин, засадил занозу, едва не погиб из-за инфекции, впал в кому и ослеп. Об этом сообщает The Sun.

Мужчина, работавший плотником, занозил руку в 2020 году. Спустя некоторое время он начал мучиться от головной боли и обратился к врачу. По словам Паркина, врач поставил ему неправильный диагноз, решив, что тот потянул мышцу в спине, что якобы и вызывало головную боль.

Пациента отправили домой, однако за ночь его состояние резко ухудшилось. Деревянная щепка, застрявшая в руке Паркина, загноилась, в результате чего он заразился бактериальным менингитом и перенес инсульт. Помимо этого, у Паркина возник сепсис, абсцесс легких и пневмония. Врачи ввели пациента в медикаментозную кому и подключили к системе жизнеобеспечения. Благодаря усилиям медиков пациент выжил и пошел на поправку. Вскоре его выписали из больницы. Несмотря на выздоровление, он частично ослеп и навсегда получил инвалидность. В течение двух лет после произошедшего Паркин и его семья пытались восстановить психическое здоровье мужчины, переживавшего, что никогда не сможет заниматься любимым делом. «Я не могу избавиться от чувства вины, но я полагаю, что это часть родительской жизни», — говорит мать мужчины. Сам Паркин посещает психолога и утверждает, что ему стало морально легче.

0;«Русалки» спасли тонущего дайвера;"Три аквалангистки, 26-летняя Элайна Гарсия и ее коллеги, проводящие занятия по курсу «Русалки» в профессиональной ассоциации инструкторов по дайвингу, спасли тонущего мужчину в дайвинг-центре Casino Point в штате Калифорния, США. Об этом сообщает People.

Инцидент произошел 23 октября. Дайверы с 46-летним стажем Пабло Авила и Хавьер Кларамунт с сыном Джошуа плавали под водой. В какой-то момент Кларамунт проверил кислородные баллоны и решил, что им пора подниматься наверх. «Я подплыл к Авиле и предложил ему подняться, он согласился. Это последнее, что он помнит», — рассказал Хавьер.

Вскоре после того, как дайверы поднялись на поверхность, Кларамунт увидел, что изо рта у Авилы идет пена. По его предположениям, Авила слишком быстро поднимался и, возможно, задержал дыхание или у него возникли проблемы со снаряжением для подводного плавания. Он снял маску с потерявшего сознание друга и попытался очистить его рот от пены. Они с сыном поплыли с Авилой к берегу, взывая о помощи. Гарсия заметила мужчин и бросилась на помощь. «Я бежала в хвосте русалки так быстро, как только могла», — вспоминает она. Добравшись до Авилы, она поняла, что он не дышит, и начала оказывать ему первую помощь. Коллеги Гарсии помогли ей снять акваланг с пострадавшего и вытащили его на берег.

Авилу поместили в кислородную камеру, чтобы избежать аэроэмболии, и он пришел в себя. «Я не думала, что он выживет. У него не было пульса, он не дышал. Я думаю, это редкость, когда человек возвращается к жизни после такого», — утверждает Гарсия. Все они были рады, что спасли человека и подарили ему возможность прожить долгую и счастливую жизнь.

У инвесторов появится возможность приобрести аналог традиционного инструмента, обезличенного металлического счета, в удобном цифровом формате. ЦФА на золото позволит получить инвестиционный доход в зависимости от динамики цены на золото.

Преимущество нового финансового инструмента — быстрый и удобный процесс заключения сделки, которая совершается в информационной системе по заявке инвестора с использованием смарт-контракта без участия посредников. Инвесторы также смогут передавать активы другим пользователям платформы, что обеспечит вторичный оборот ЦФА.

«Российский рынок цифровых финансовых активов находится на начальном этапе своего развития. Тем не менее, мы видим, что цифровые активы имеют большие перспективы для клиентов банка и позволяют вывести уже существующие финансовые инструменты на новый уровень. Выпуск ЦФА на золото именно сейчас — своевременная мера в меняющемся финансовом ландшафте. Золото — ликвидный инвестиционный и защитный актив, вложения в который особенно актуальны для бизнеса в сегодняшней ситуации», — говорит Анатолий Попов, заместитель председателя правления Сбербанка.

Цифровые финансовые активы — это финансовый инструмент в цифровом формате. Их выпуск, учет и обращение осуществляются на основе распределенного реестра (технология блокчейн), который гарантирует неизменность данных.

Такое мнение высказал политолог, член Общественной палаты РФ, первый заместитель Института стратегических исследований и прогнозов (ИСИП) РУДН Никита Данюк.

Комментируя новость о том, что недавно вернувшийся на территорию России в рамках обмена заключенными с США россиянин Виктор Бут стал членом партии ЛДПР, эксперт отметил, что Виктор Бут теперь не только узнаваем, но и способен объединить патриотично настроенных россиян — в первую очередь тех, которые придерживаются в большей степени консервативных и при этом правых взглядов.

Никита Данюк отметил, что депутат Леонид Слуцкий и другие представители партии ЛДПР активно занимались работой, направленной на то, чтобы этот обмен состоялся. «Слуцкий, как председатель комитета по международным делам, был активно вовлечен в эту повестку и, конечно, это скажется на рейтинге ЛДПР», — считает эксперт.

Он уверен, что если Бут — медийная персона, за которой строит «большая история», сможет стать настоящим спикером, лидером партии, со своими задачами, это пойдет ЛДПР на пользу и вскоре отразится на рейтингах.

0;Акула напала на мужа с женой и утащила женщину под воду;"На гавайском острове Мауи в США акула напала на мужа и жену и утянула женщину под воду. Об этом сообщает People.

Отдыхающие плавали под водой с маской и дыхательной трубкой, когда их внезапно атаковала акула. Муж и жена отбились от хищной рыбы и поплыли к берегу. Мужчина выбрался на сушу, но его жены нигде не было. Попытки найти ее не увенчались успехом, и он обратился к спасателям.

Предполагается, что акула утащила женщину под воду, когда она пыталась доплыть до берега. Позже недалеко от места, где плавали муж и жена, была найдена часть купального костюма и комплект для подводного плавания. Пожарная служба и сотрудники службы безопасности океана Мауи начали поиски женщины в воде и с воздуха.

Согласно местной политике в отношении происшествий, связанных с акулами, спасатели не могут предоставить никакой личной информации о пострадавших. Известно лишь, что пропавшей женщине было 60 лет, она приехала из штата Вашингтон.

0;Россиянам перечислили признаки перелома из-за падения на льду;"Отек и отсутствие подвижности конечности являются симптомами перелома, объяснил травматолог-ортопед Ренат Исмаилов. Он перечислил россиянам и некоторые другие признаки распространенной зимней травмы, а также назвал меры первой доврачебной помощи в беседе с Life.

Помимо отека и нарушения подвижности руки или ноги, заподозрить перелом после падения в гололедицу можно при наличии таких симптомов, как припухлость, отек, гематома, сильная боль, которая может сопровождаться хрустом. Также при данной травме может измениться форма поврежденной конечности, заявил Исмаилов. В этом случае стоит как можно быстрее вызвать врача. До приезда скорой можно оказать пострадавшему первую помощь. Травматолог рекомендовал зафиксировать поврежденную область подручными средствами: одинаково хорошо для этих целей подойдут зонт, палка, журнал или футляр для очков. Затем можно на 10 минут приложить лед или что-то холодное, чтобы минимизировать отек, и дать человеку обезболивающее.

«Ни в коем случае не пытаться осуществить резкое движение травмированной конечностью, так как оно может привести к резкому ухудшению состояния, шоковому состоянию, с возможным развитием внутреннего кровотечения при повреждении магистральных сосудов острым осколком костной ткани», — подчеркнул Исмаилов.

0;Ученые придумали, как достичь эффекта невидимости;"Ученые ТПУ совместно с зарубежными коллегами разработали и протестировали формулу для создания многонаправленного эффекта оптической невидимости. Они использовали полностью диэлектрическую среду, которая скрывает металлический материал или объект от падающей плоской волны. Результаты исследования опубликованы в журнале Nanomaterials.
Одним из самых интригующих и загадочных оптических явлений является ""невидимость"". В общем случае оптическая ""невидимость"" означает, что электромагнитная волна, падающая на объект, должна сохранять свои свойства (амплитуду и фазу) после прохождения через объект. В общем случае это невозможно из-за эффектов дифракции, рефракции и рассеяния волн. Для реализации электромагнитной ""невидимости"", поле за теневой частью объекта, который предполагается сделать ""невидимым"" должно быть реконструировано и скорректировано, чтобы оно совпадало с падающей волной. Пионерские работы в этой области были сделаны Ульфом Леонхардтом и Джоном Брайаном Пендри около 15 лет назад. Новое направление получило название трансформационной оптики. С тех пор ученые предложили много различных физических концепций к построению ""невидимых"" оптических материалов и поверхностей, сообщил профессор отделения электронной инженерии Инженерной школы неразрушающего контроля и безопасности Томского политехнического университета (ТПУ) Игорь Минин. Разработанный ""плащ"" состоит из полилактида (PLA), который представляет собой биоразлагаемый термопластичный полимер с низкими потерями и низким значением диэлектрической проницаемости. Этот диэлектрический материал широко используется в технологии трехмерной аддитивной печати. ""Преимущество и новизна предложенной схемы состоит в том, что в отличие от методов трансформационной оптики, требующей использования искусственных материалов, отсутствующих в природе, наш подход основан на использовании широко распространенных диэлектрических материалов. Используя этот подход, была разработана структура для создания эффекта невидимости, которая обеспечивает его электромагнитное ""скрытие"" с разных направлений"", – пояснил Минин. Исследования были выполнены на основе моделирования с помощью решения трехмерных уравнений Максвелла, после чего было, используя эффект масштабируемости, проведено их экспериментальное подтверждение в микроволновом диапазоне.
Игорь Минин отметил, что, несмотря на фундаментальный характер работы, рассмотренные эффекты могут быть использованы для создания различных датчиков, которые при интеграции в исследуемую среду не вызывают искажений поля и не влияют на результат измерений. Дальнейшая задача научного коллектива – расширять возможности метода и оптимизировать его характеристики.

0;В КФУ повысили точность проверки действия лекарств на раковые клетки;"Сотрудники Казанского федерального университета (КФУ) создали тест-систему, позволяющую изучать эффективность лекарств против метастатической нейробластомы – крайне опасной раковой опухоли центральной нервной системы. Особенность новой разработки в том, что она более точно, чем прежде, учитывает свойства опухоли, влияющие на ее устойчивость к препаратам, сообщили РИА Новости в министерстве науки и высшего образования РФ. Новая тест-система представляет собой модель метастатического очага опухоли нейробластомы, в которой учитывается влияние на нее соседних клеток, а также клеток иммунной системы. Тест-систему разработали ученые научно-исследовательской лаборатории ""Генные и клеточные технологии"" Института фундаментальной медицины и биологии КФУ. ""В качестве нового подхода для моделирования процессов, происходящих в опухолевом микроокружении, нами был предложен метод совместного культивирования нескольких популяций клеток, входящих в состав опухолевой ткани, с использованием специального каркаса ткани – внеклеточного матрикса"", – добавил ученый. Для создания модели метастаз исследователи использовали три популяции клеток – ключевых участников опухоли: стволовые клетки из костного мозга, смесь иммунных клеток крови, а также линию клеток нейробластомы человека. Они были прокультивированы совместно. Исследование показало, что клетки в таком ""наборе"" активно ""общались"" друг с другом. Стволовые и иммунные клетки способствовали созданию воспалительной среды, характерной для злокачественной опухоли.
Выяснилось, что в этом случае раковые клетки более устойчивы к действию противоопухолевого препарата, чем злокачественные клетки, культивируемые при стандартных условиях. Кроме того, межклеточные взаимодействия приводили к изменению работы ряда генов, участвующих в клеточной гибели и в процессах, связанных со злокачественным перерождением как в опухолевых, так и в стволовых и иммунных клетках.
Испытания противоопухолевого препарата с помощью новой модели прошли успешно.
""Стандартные методы тестирования на однотипных опухолевых клетках не всегда дают точные результаты, так как состав и микроокружение опухоли в организме гораздо сложнее, здоровые и опухолевые клетки поддерживают друг друга, трехмерная организация опухоли оказывает влияние на проницаемость лекарственных препаратов"", – отметила участник работы, младший научный сотрудник лаборатории ""Генные и клеточные технологии"" Кристина Китаева.
В будущем планируется разработать более сложные модели опухоли in vitro, которые можно будет использовать для высокотехнологичного скрининга противоопухолевых препаратов, добавила она.
Проект выполняется в рамках программы Минобрнауки России ""Приоритет 2030"".
Нейробластома – одна из самых распространенных разновидностей опухолей, характерных для детей младшего возраста. Она характеризуется высокой вероятностью развития устойчивости к химиопрепаратам.

1;Freed Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout says he ‘wholeheartedly’ supports Ukraine war and would volunteer if he could;"Freed Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout said on Saturday he “wholeheartedly” supports Moscow’s so-called “military operation” in Ukraine and that if he had the opportunity and necessary skills, he would “certainly go as a volunteer.”

Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death” by his accusers, was released Thursday from US detention in a prisoner swap for US basketball star Brittney Griner.

Bout made the remarks in a video interview with Kremlin-controlled TV network RT. He was interviewed by Maria Butina, a Russian gun-rights enthusiast-turned TV personality who now works for the network.

In the interview, he denied any connections with the Taliban and that he supplied arms to Afghanistan. When asked if he had a portrait of President Vladimir Putin in his prison cell, Bout said: “Yes, always. Why not? I’m proud that I’m Russian and that our president is Putin.”

The former Soviet military officer was serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout, who had maintained his innocence, is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents.

Griner, 32, returned to the United States early Friday after being released from custody in an exchange for an international arms dealer. She was “in good spirits” and “incredibly gracious,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. Griner – who had played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – was arrested on drugs charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.

The swap, which US President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair.

1;Taiwan reports record incursion by Chinese bomber aircraft;"China has sent a record 18 nuclear-capable H-6 bomber aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense zone, the island’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, as Beijing continues to step-up pressure on the self-ruled island.

The 18 bombers were part of 21 total Chinese warplanes sent into Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone – a buffer of airspace commonly referred to as an ADIZ – in the 24-hour span between Monday morning and Tuesday morning, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.

The ministry said it monitored the situation and employed its fighter jets as well as land-based missile systems to track the Chinese planes.

The flights represent the largest number of H-6 sorties in a 24-hour period since Taipei began releasing daily data on Chinese fighter incursions in 2020.

An ADIZ is unilaterally imposed and distinct from sovereign airspace, which is defined under international law as extending 12 nautical miles from a territory’s shoreline.

China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan – a democratically governed island of 24 million – as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it. It has long vowed to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary.

Tensions surrounding Taiwan have increased markedly this year. A visit to the island by United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August prompted Chinese fury and an immediate flurry of military exercises.

Since then, Beijing has stepped up military pressure tactics on the island, sending fighter jets across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan and China. For decades, the median line had served as an informal demarcation line between the two, with military incursions across it being rare.

In November, US President Joe Biden met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in-person for the first time during his presidency at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Afterward, Biden described the three-hour meeting as “open and candid,” and cast doubt on an imminent invasion of Taiwan.

Formal bilateral talks on climate cooperation are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi – with China having previously halted talks as part of retaliation for Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/asia/taiwan-chinese-bombers-incursion-intl-hnk
1;Soccer union ‘sickened’ by reports Iranian player faces possible execution;"The global soccer players’ union, FIFPRO, said it is “shocked and sickened” by reports that Iranian soccer player Amir Nasr-Azadani faces the possibility of execution “after campaigning for women’s rights and basic freedom in his country.”

“We stand in solidarity with Amir and call for the immediate removal of his punishment,” FIFPRO said in a statement posted on Twitter on Monday.

Nasr-Azadani has been accused of being a member of an “armed group” that was involved in the death of three security officers during protests in the city of Esfahan in central Iran, said the city’s chief justice Asadullah Jafari, according to state news agency IRNA on Sunday.

In the report, Jafari said Nasr-Azadani had been charged with rioting against authorities. He has been in custody since November 27, but no sentence has been issued yet for the accused, the report added.

It’s unclear when his trial is scheduled to begin. Anti-government protests have raged in Iran since September, sparked initially by the case of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being apprehended by the state’s morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.

Public anger over Amini’s death has combined with a range of grievances against the Islamic Republic’s oppressive regime to fuel the demonstrations even in the face of harsh punishments, and possibly the death sentence. The 26-year-old footballer, from the historic city of Esfahan, had played for the Iranian professional football clubs Rah-Ahan, Tractor and Gol Reyhan, reported London-based activist outlet IranWire.

Under Iran’s penal code, his sentence could carry the death penalty if proven that the accused had used a firearm, otherwise he could be sentenced to prison.

Iran executed a second man allegedly involved in the nationwide protest movement after he was convicted of fatally stabbing two security officials last month, Mizan Online, a news agency affiliated with Iran’s judiciary, and the semi-official Tasmin news agency reported on Monday.

1;At least seven dead as Peru protests disrupt flights and train travel;"At least seven people have died in ongoing protests in Peru after former President Pedro Castillo was impeached and later arrested after trying to dissolve Congress last week.

Two minors are among the dead, Peru’s ombudsman’s press office told CNNE on Tuesday, and there were two deaths on Sunday and five on Monday.

Since last week, demonstrations have erupted in cities across the country in support of Castillo, who has not accepted his removal from office and has branded his successor Dina Boluarte an “usurper.” Demonstrators have called for a general election, the dissolution of Congress, and the creation of a new constituent assembly, according to the radio and television broadcaster Radio Programas del Per?.

Trains to and from Machu Picchu will be suspended from Tuesday due to the protests, railway operator PeruRail said in a statement.

“We regret the inconvenience that these announcements generate for our passengers; however, they are due to situations beyond the control of our company and seek to prioritize the safety of passengers and workers,” the statement read.

Flights have also been disrupted due to protests, with LATAM Airlines Peru announcing the temporary suspension of services to and from airports in the cities of Arequipa and Cuzco.

Protesters attempted to storm the terminal at Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport in Cuzco on Monday, according to the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation (CORPAC).

So far there have been no reports of injuries, arrests or damage to the airport, according to CORPAC. LATAM called on Peruvian authorities to take “corrective measures to ensure safety” for the operation of its flights.

“We regret the inconvenience that this situation beyond our control has caused our passengers,” it added.

Peru’s National Police said that, as of Monday evening, there were blockades on national roads in at least 11 regions of the country.

In addition, the government has declared a state of emergency in seven provinces in the Apurimac region in south-central Peru. Peru has been racked with political instability in recent years, and has been on the brink since Castillo was impeached for attempting to dissolve the nation’s Congress last week.

And Boluarte’s ascendency to the presidency may not necessarily ease Peru’s toxic and embittered political landscape.

Many Peruvians have been calling for political change, according to a September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies, which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress. Boluarte “does not have a recognized political career,” said Fernando Tuesta Soldevilla, professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. “And without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.”

“Everyone knows when Dina Boluarte’s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,” he told CNN.

On Monday morning, Boluarte proposed bringing general elections forward two years, to April 2024, after initially rejecting the idea.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/americas/peru-protests-tuesday-intl
1;Indian and Chinese troops clash on disputed border;"Indian and Chinese troops have clashed on their disputed Himalayan border, the first known incident between the two nuclear-armed Asian powers in nearly two years.

In a statement, India’s Ministry of Defense said soldiers from both sides sustained minor injuries in the face-off, which took place Friday in the Tawang Sector in India’s northeastern territory of Arunachal Pradesh, a remote, inhospitable region that borders southern China.

The 2,100 mile-long (3,379-kilometer) disputed border has long been the source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing, with tensions escalating sharply in June 2020 when hand-to-hand fighting between the two sides resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers in Aksai Chin-Ladakh.

Speaking to lawmakers Tuesday, India’s Defense Minister Rajnath Singh accused China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops of trying to “unilaterally” change the status quo by attempting to cross the line of actual control (LAC) – the two countries’ de facto border.

“The ensuing faceoff led to a physical scuffle in which the Indian Army bravely prevented the PLA from transgressing into our territory and compelled them to return to their posts,” Singh said, adding there were no serious injuries on the Indian side.

In its earlier statement, the Indian Defense Ministry said both sides “immediately disengaged from the area” and the countries’ respective commanders there held a flag meeting to discuss the issue in “accordance with structured mechanisms to restore peace and tranquility.” Singh said that meeting occurred Sunday and the Chinese side was “asked to refrain from such actions and maintain peace and tranquility” along the border. The issue was also being addressed through diplomatic channels, he added.

China’s Foreign Ministry did not directly acknowledge the incident in a regularly scheduled news briefing on Tuesday.

“As far as we know, the China-India border area is generally stable, and both sides have maintained smooth communications on boundary-related issues through diplomatic and military channels,” spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked about India’s statement on the incident, pointing reporters to “competent authorities” for “specifics.”

China hoped India would be “on the same page” to “jointly preserve the peace and stability of the China-India border,” he added.

Disputed border
India and China went to war over their border regions in 1962, eventually establishing the LAC. But the two countries do not agree on its precise location and both regularly accuse the other of overstepping it, or seeking to expand their territory. There have been a series of mostly non-lethal scuffles over the position of the border in the years since, including the previously most recent known example in 2021, according to a statement from the Indian Army at the time.

In September, the Indian government said that Indian and Chinese troops had begun disengaging from the Gogra-Hotsprings border area in the western Himalayas, two years after clashes at the frontier strained diplomatic ties. That statement came ahead of a regional summit in Uzbekistan attended by both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Activities in the region remain closely watched on both sides.

On November 30, China’s Foreign Ministry criticized high altitude joint exercises conducted between US and Indian troops in northern India’s Uttarakhand, saying that the exercises did “not help build bilateral trust” and that Beijing had expressed concerns to New Delhi.

China has grown wary of India’s ties with the United States in recent years, as China-US relations have cratered and the Quad security dialogue, which includes India, the US, and American allies Japan and Australia has become more active.

Modi and Chinese leader Xi last met at the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Bali last month, where the two shook hands but did not have a bilateral sit-down.

Speaking to Parliament last week prior to the skirmish, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said there had been “abnormality” in China-India relations in recent years due to border concerns, and that New Delhi “diplomatically” had been “very clear” with China that they “will not tolerate attempts to unilaterally change” the LAC.

“So long as they continue to seek to do that, and if they have built up forces, which in our minds constitute a serious concern in the border areas, then our relationship is not normal,” Jaishankar said, in response to a question on Sino-Indian relations, adding that the military commanders “continue to engage each other.”";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/asia/india-china-border-dispute-skirmish-tawang-sector-intl-hnk
1;Leaving his life in Bakhmut had seemed impossible. Now he’s lost a friend, a limb and a livelihood;"Editor’s Note: Warning: This story contains details some readers may find disturbing.

Kostiantynivka, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
The streets outside Vyacheslav Tarasov’s home on Ukraine’s eastern frontline are pocked by shell blasts. The buildings around are mostly empty, windowless and cold.

Bakhmut has been facing the relentless firepower of a frustrated Russian army for months. In its pursuit of an increasingly rare battlefield victory, Moscow has leveled buildings with rockets and missiles and sent endless waves of infantry to fight among the destroyed homes.

Tarasov, 48, was sheltering from the shelling in his basement where he now has to live. But last week he dared to venture out – to buy vegetables to make the national dish, borscht.

“I don’t know what was used,” he recalls. “But the force was incredible because my arm flew off, just like that… I was holding my guts in my hands.” His face pales as he relays the graphic images still fresh in his mind. “I was wearing a leather jacket and if it wasn’t for that, I would have blown apart. I mean, my guts would have been all over the place… I lost a lot of blood. I remember seeing it — a huge puddle.”

The blast that tore through Tarasov’s body killed his friend and as the shelling continued, he realized he might not make it either. “I’ll tell you the truth,” he says. “I prayed to survive.”

Tarasov is a devout Christian and believes an “invisible power” saved his life. He is also grateful to the Ukrainian soldiers who threw him in their pickup truck and drove him to a hospital in Kostiantynivka — one of the few remaining hospitals able to treat the war’s civilian wounded.

When Tarasov arrived, he begged the doctors to save his limb. “The first thing I asked was if I could have my arm sewn back on. I saw that it was completely torn off and was just hanging in the sleeve. And my stomach was burning. I figured it must be the intestines coming out. There was blood everywhere.” Medical staff at Kostiantynivka have been continuing their work through power failures and water shortages caused by repeated Russian attacks on the energy grid. For eight hours one day last week, they had to rely on generators to keep the lights and heating on.

“Sometimes the power goes out,” chief surgeon Dr. Yuri Mishasty tells CNN, still dressed in his scrubs. “Water comes by the hour, not regularly. There was no water at the weekend because there was a catastrophic shelling incident.”

The surgeon, 62, has just finished operating on a woman who had been rushed in earlier that afternoon.

“She’s a resident of Bakhmut. She came under artillery fire and suffered a shrapnel wound to her abdomen with damage to several organs. We see people with these wounds every day. Every day.” As the Russian army intensifies its campaign to take Bakhmut, the shelling comes ever nearer to Kostiantynivka, 25 kilometres (about 15 miles) to the west. Since the beginning of the month, the town has been hit almost every day, the hospital director says. Meanwhile, medical staff hear the constant thud of artillery fired around Bakhmut – unwelcome signals that another patient may soon lie on the operating table.

“It’s been quite loud lately,” Khassan El-Kafarna, a surgeon from Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF), stationed at the hospital, says. His colleague, nurse Lucia Marron, agrees. “I think there’s more movement around in general – more troops, more people,” she says. “We are used to the sound. You get to a point where you understand what is dangerous and what is not.”

The local authorities have implored civilians to leave the region for months. But for Tarasov, as for so many in Ukraine’s old industrial heartland, fleeing his home for a safer area had seemed impossible.

“If I had a lot of money, I would rather live abroad,” Tarasov says. “But I have no money and everything I had saved up was invested there. I had no money and nowhere to go.”

To stay in Bakhmut was to cling on to what remained of the life he worked so hard for during peacetime. That life has now changed irrevocably.

A builder before war came to Ukraine, Tarasov says, “I was right-handed. Now I won’t even be able to roll a measuring tape.

“I’m half-man, half-zombie. Half-human to be exact.”";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/europe/ukraine-bakhmut-injured-civilians-intl-cmd
1;Massive Martian dust devil passed over the Perseverance rover, and it recorded the eerie sounds;"A towering whirlwind of dust passed right over the Perseverance rover as it explored the site of an ancient lake on Mars – and the rover recorded the first sounds of this Martian dust devil using its microphone.

Dust devils, or dust whirlwinds, are common on Mars, and they’re part of the weather patterns on the red planet.

Other missions have gathered images, weather data and dust measurements of these events, and the NASA InSight lander even recorded seismic and magnetic signals created by the dust devils. But sound has been the missing element — until now. When the Perseverance rover landed on Mars in February 2021, it became the first mission to carry microphones on a journey to the red planet.

The robotic explorer’s SuperCam microphone just happened to be turned on and recording on September 27, 2021, when a dust devil passed directly over the rover, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.

During an 11-second clip captured by the microphone, there are two periods of low frequency wind as the leading and trailing walls of the dust devil pass over the rover, said lead study author Dr. Naomi Murdoch, researcher at the University of Toulouse’s Higher Institute of Aeronautics and Space. In between the walls of the whirlwind is a calm period when the rover was in the eye of the vortex, Murdoch said.

Crackling and hissing can be heard during the event, which were determined to be dust grains hitting the rover.

The researchers were able to count the particles in the dust devil as they hit the rover, leading to a completely new type of measurement on the red planet, Murdoch said. It’s the first time an instrument has been able to quantify lofted dust on Mars. Images and other data sent back by the rover also confirmed what happened. When the researchers pieced all of the elements collected by the rover together, they determined that the dust devil reached more than 387 feet (118 meters) tall and spanned 82 feet (25 meters wide) – about 10 times larger than the rover itself. While this sounds like a massive whirlwind, it’s the average size for Martian dust devils, Murdoch said.

The researchers were surprised to discover that dust accumulated inside the dust devil, rather than just being carried inside the outer walls – possible because the dust devil may still have been in the process of forming as it moved over Perseverance.

Dust devils serve as indicators of turbulence in the atmosphere on Mars and they play an important role in the Martian dust cycle. Learning more about how dust becomes lofted and moves on the red planet – a key feature of its weather and climate since dust is its main feature – can help scientists better understand the formation and evolution of dust storms. A planet-encircling dust storm is what ended the Opportunity rover’s 15-year mission in 2018.

“Global dust storms are important for understanding the Martian climate,” Murdoch said. “The acoustic measurements of dust impacts and dust lifting will, therefore, improve our understanding of dust devils and will also help to improve Martian climate models. Understanding dust lifting is also critical for space missions due to the damage that can be caused to hardware.”

Perseverance’s wind sensors have already been damaged due to lofted dust particles likely carried by wind or a dust devil, Murdoch said. Dust devils have a reputation for being both helpful and harmful on Mars.

The InSight lander’s mission is expected to end this month after spending four years studying quakes and other phenomenon on the red planet. Layers of dust have collected on its solar panels and prevented the spacecraft from collecting enough power to continue operating its instruments.

Dust devils occur frequently in Jezero Crater, where Perseverance landed, but they seem to be absent at InSight’s home in the flat plain of Elysium Planitia – and researchers aren’t sure why.

“In the case of InSight, the dust has settled out of the atmosphere onto the solar panels. However, because there are no whirlwinds capable of lifting dust in the region of InSight, the whirlwinds are not able to ‘clean’ the solar panels.” Other Mars missions have actually benefited from regular cleanings by dust devils, which acted like vacuum cleaners for the dust collected on the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity rovers and provided them with longer-than-expected lifespans. The University of Toulouse’s Higher Institute of Aeronautics and Space, known as ISAE-SUPAERO, built the microphone that sits on Perseverance. Every month, Murdoch and her team collect eight recordings lasting about 167 seconds each.

“We estimate that a single microphone observation in the mid-day period (the time of day when there is the most dust devil activity) has only a 1 in 200 chance of recording a dust devil like the one we encountered,” Murdoch said. “We definitely got lucky, but we also carefully targeted the instrument observations to increase the chances of success.” More microphone recordings could capture additional dust devils, and Murdoch’s team is using acoustic recordings to measure atmospheric turbulence to determine its range on Mars.

The SuperCam microphone was originally included to listen as instruments on the rover zap rocks to determine their properties, but its acoustic data is also shedding light on the atmospheric science possibilities on the red planet, Murdoch said.

1;Former US pilot held in Australia faces charges over training Chinese military pilot;"Former US Marine pilot Daniel Duggan, who was arrested earlier this year in Australia, is accused of breaking US arms control law by training Chinese military pilots to land on aircraft carriers, according to an indictment unsealed by a US court.

The 2017 indictment, released Friday by the District of Columbia court, said “Duggan provided military training to PRC (People’s Republic of China) pilots” through a South African flight school on three occasions in 2010 and 2012.

It lists unnamed co-conspirators including one South African and one British national who were executives of “a test flying academy based in South Africa with a presence in the PRC,” and a Chinese national who acquired military information for the Chinese military.

Britain announced a crackdown on its former military pilots working to train Chinese military fliers the same week Duggan was arrested in Australia.

Australian police provisionally arrested Duggan in the rural town of Orange at the request of the US government in October, pending a likely extradition request by the United States. Duggan’s lawyer, Dennis Miralis of Australian law firm Nyman Gibson Miralis, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the indictment.

He has previously said Duggan denies breaching any law, and is an Australian citizen who had renounced his US citizenship.

The court also unsealed a US warrant for Duggan on Friday.

Duggan faces four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States by conspiracy to unlawfully export defense services to China, conspiracy to launder money, and two counts of violating the arms export control act and international traffic in arms regulations.

He is now being held in custody in Sydney, and his case will return to a Sydney court this week. The US must lodge an extradition request for Duggan by December 20 under a bilateral treaty. Training foreign forces
The indictment said Duggan was allegedly contracted directly by the unnamed Chinese national to provide services to a Chinese state owned company, including evaluations of Chinese military pilot trainees, testing of naval aviation related equipment and instruction on tactics related to landing aircraft on aircraft carriers.

Duggan did not seek authorization from the United States government to provide military training to China, although the US State Department had informed him by email in 2008 this was required to train a foreign air force, it said.

The indictment alleges he traveled frequently between Australia, the United States, China and South Africa between 2009 and 2012, when he was a US citizen and Australian citizen.

Duggan’s alleged violation of an arms embargo imposed on China by the United States also included providing aviation services in China in 2010, and providing an assessment of China’s aircraft carrier training, it said. The indictment alleges the Chinese national brokered a deal between the South African flight school and a Chinese state owned enterprise to provide aircraft carrier landing training to Chinese military pilots in South Africa and China.

A T-2 Buckeye aircraft was purchased from a US aircraft dealer for this training, by providing false information that resulted in the US government issuing an export license, it said.

Duggan moved to Australia in 2002 after a decade in the US Marines, later moving to Beijing in 2014 where he worked as an aviation consultant. He returned to Australia from China weeks before he was arrested, according to his lawyer.

Reuters previously reported that in 2014 Duggan shared a Beijing address with a Chinese businessman, Su Bin, who was arrested in Canada in July 2014 and sentenced to prison in the US two years later after pleading guilty in a high-profile hacking case involving the theft of US military aircraft designs.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/australia/daniel-duggan-pilot-china-australia-intl-hnk
1;South African President Ramaphosa will not be impeached over cash-in sofa scandal;"South African President Ramaphosa survived a move to start impeachment proceedings against him in a vote in parliament on Tuesday.

The move was widely expected, after the top leadership ruling African National Congress (ANC) called on their parliamentary caucus to block the investigation.

One by one, MPs were asked to articulate their vote in person after requests to hold the vote in secret will ruled out by the Speaker of Parliament.

There were a few ‘yes’ votes from ANC members, and a couple of no-shows, but their caucus largely held together. Opposition parties were mostly unified on calling for an impeachment enquiry. The vote required a simple majority. 

The vote came after an independent panel independent panel found there is initial evidence that he could have violated his oath of office. The findings relate to an ongoing scandal linked to the theft of more than $500,000 in cash from his private game farm in 2020. The cash was stuffed inside a leather sofa according to the panel investigation.

The panel, led by a former chief justice, found that the crime was not reported to the police and that there was a ‘deliberate decision to keep the investigation secret.’

After initial speculation that he would resign, Ramaphosa’s lawyers have sought to challenge the panel’s findings in court. The president has repeatedly denied the allegations saying the money was from the sale of wildlife at his Phala Phala farm.

Later this week, the president will contest an ANC elective conference, where he is widely expected to win.

The vote was preceded by a spirited debate where opposition party leaders lambasted both the president for not providing a fuller explanation for the cash and the ANC caucus for backing him. “You are so desperate to avoid any type of investigation into the crimes that have occurred in and in relation to the Phala Phala farm that you have decided to spit in the face of the freedoms and institutions so many people fought and died for,” said Julius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters.

“As long as you have the numbers in parliament, you can make any scandal go away and if that is how you intend to vote today, in one unified shield against accountability and oversight, just like you did in the Zuma days then shame on you,” said John Steenhuisen, the leader of the official opposition Democratic Alliance, referring to Ramaphosa’s predecessor Jacob Zuma who was never censured by parliament, but was eventually forced to resign after a corruption scandal.

ANC members said that the report did not provide enough evidence to move towards an impeachment proceeding. The president still could face multiple investigations outside of parliament.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/africa/south-africa-ramaphosa-impeachment-vote-intl
1;Peru’s new president calls for elections as Castillo speaks out;"Peru’s new President Dina Boluarte has proposed bringing general elections forward two years to April 2024, during a televised speech delivered early Monday morning, amid ongoing protests throughout the country.

“Interpreting the will of the citizens… I have decided to take the initiative to reach an agreement with the Congress of the Republic to advance general elections to the month of April of 2024,” Boluarte said in the televised address.

Boluarte became Peru’s first female president last week after lawmakers removed her predecessor Pedro Castillo.

She initially ruled out early elections last week, but protests calling for political change have ensued around the country, leaving at least two people dead and prompting the United Nations Human Rights Office to air its concern about escalated tensions.

“With violence increasing as protests continue in Peru, we are deeply concerned that the situation may escalate further,” its spokesperson Marta Hurtado said. “Given the number of protests, including strikes, planned for this week, we call on all involved to exercise restraint.” Since last week, protests erupted in cities across the country in support of Castillo, who is currently under a seven-day preliminary arrest ordered by Peru’s Supreme Court and has not accepted his removal, calling Boluarte an “usurper.”

Demonstrators have called for another general election, the dissolution of Congress, and the creation of a new constituent assembly, according to the radio and television broadcaster Radio Programas del Per?.

On Saturday, protesters also demonstrated in the city of Andahuaylas, which left at least 20 people injured including four police officers, according to Peru’s Ombudsman’s Office.

Peru’s Ministry of Health said Sunday evening that two people have died and three hospitalized in the Apur?mac Region, where Andahuaylas Province is located, as a result of the protests.

Castillo on Monday insisted that he is still Peru’s President, according to a series of tweets posted on his Twitter account. He was impeached for attempting to dissolve the nation’s Congress and for calling for new elections.

“I am unconditionally faithful to the popular and constitutional mandate that I hold as President, and I WILL NOT RESIGN OR ABANDON MY HIGH AND SACRED FUNCTIONS,” a portion of the message reads.

Castillo also claimed that he had been “kidnapped,” as well as “humiliated” and “mistreated,”and called for his own release, according to a handwritten letter he wrote which was also posted to his account on Monday.

Castillo’s lawyer, Ronald Atencio, has verified the authenticity of the letter and the tweets to CNN. The tweets were authorized by the former president to be written on his behalf. Rising anger
On Monday, Alfredo Rodriguez Ballon airport in Peru’s largest southern city of Arequipa was temporarily closed due to protests, according to a statement by the Andean Airports of Peru, tweeted by the country’s Ministry of Transport and Communications.

“Our Alfredo Rodriguez Ball?n airport in the city of Arequipa has been invaded by a group of protesters who have entered through the perimeter fence, destroying the security infrastructure and setting fire to security gate, which has put the safety of passengers, our team and air operations at risk,” read the statement.

Images of the scene showed smoke in the distance while protesters walked on the airport’s runway.

The airport evacuated those inside the terminal, and later on Monday, officials told local media that the situation was “under control.”

“The situation at Arequipa is under control, police has control of the airport (inside). We ask citizens to exercise their right to protest but in a peaceful way and not to put at risk people’s lives,” Angel Manrique of the Ombudsman’s Office in Arequipa said in an interview with local radio RPP on Monday.

In footage from the southern city of Ica, a vehicle was overturned and protesters blocked streets. Police were seen clashing with demonstrators, who were throwing stones at the forces. On Sunday, at least 50 people, including police officers and airport workers, were also being held as “hostages” after attacks and “acts of vandalism” by protesters at the Huancabamba de Andahuaylas airport in the city of Andahuaylas, the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation said in a statement.

The airport has been closed as a result, the organization said, adding that they have asked the national police for support and reinforcement and to help “safeguard the lives of the people who are being held hostage.” The organization did not provide information on the condition of the hostages.

Peru’s Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation accused protesters of setting fire to the airport’s transmission room, fuel room and encircling the terminal with “acts of violence,” it said in a statement. It also said the landing strip and essential equipment had been “seriously affected.”

The country has been on the brink since Castillo’s ouster last week.

Many Peruvians have been calling for a change in the political guard, according to September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP), which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress.

Boluarte’s ascendency to the presidency may not necessarily ease Peru’s toxic and embittered political landscape.

Fernando Tuesta Soldevilla, professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), told CNN that Boluarte “does not have a recognized political career. And without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.”

“Everyone knows when Dina Boluarte’s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,” he said.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/americas/peru-protests-election-president-intl-latam
1;These are the missile defense systems the US sent to Poland;"The two missile defense systems that the US delivered to Poland this week are part of a weapons system upon which the US military has heavily relied for nearly 40 years.

The deployment, announced Thursday by Vice President Kamala Harris, is intended to deter Russia and boost Poland’s security amid western concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill into NATO-aligned nations.

The Patriot air defense missile system – Patriot stands for “Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target” – is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles. The battery includes missiles and launching stations, a radar set that detects and tracks targets, and an engagement control station, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.

The US, seeking to avoid direct involvement in Ukraine – which is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the pact’s collective defense agreement, in which an attack on one aligned nation is considered an attack on all – has repeatedly stressed that the deployment is only for defensive purposes.

“This defensive deployment is being conducted proactively to counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory,” Capt. Adam Miller, spokesman for US European Command, said in a statement Tuesday. “This is a prudent force protection measure that underpins our commitment to Article Five and will in no way support any offensive operations.”

The Pentagon’s deployment of the Patriot missiles to Poland “wasn’t precipitated by one single moment or one single issue or one single act by the Russians,” US Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said on Wednesday.

The Patriot missiles had been moved from Germany for what Kirby described as a “temporary deployment.”

Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO commander, called the deployment of the two batteries “prudent” and said the Patriot system would be able to intercept many of the missiles Russian President Vladimir Putin has deployed in Russia and Belarus, which borders Poland.

“So if there were to be a launch in some provocative way by Mr. Putin to attempt to intimidate us, these missiles have a very good probability of intercepting a Russian missile,” Clark, now a CNN military analyst, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. He added that the deployment of the equipment “gives reassurance to the Poles. It also tells Putin that he’s not going to be necessarily so successful in trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons.” A longtime mainstay of US military operations

The Patriot missile system has undergone several improvements and upgrades since it was first deployed in 1982. Its first combat use was in the Gulf War, which was also the first time that an air defense system had destroyed a hostile tactical ballistic missile. The Patriot system was also deployed in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and was successful in hitting nine incoming missiles, but also were involved in several friendly fire incidents.

In recent years, the US has sent Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia and Iraq to counter threats posed by Iran and its proxies and to the Pacific region to deter North Korea.

Earlier this year, the US military, along with the United Arab Emirates, used the Patriot missiles to intercept attacks by Houthi militants on a military airbase where Americans were stationed and while the Israeli President was visiting the UAE.

A 2019 Pentagon missile defense review reported that eight battalions with 33 batteries were stationed in the United States while seven battalions with 27 batteries were stationed overseas. More than a dozen US allies, including Germany, Japan, and Israel, have also purchased the US missile defense system.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/us-patriot-missile-defense-system-explainer/index.html
1;China scraps virus tracking app as country braces for Covid impact;"Beijing
CNN
 — 
China is bracing for an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases as it dismantles large parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy, with a leading expert warning Omicron variants were “spreading rapidly” and signs of an outbreak rattling the country’s capital.

Changes continued Monday as authorities announced a deactivation of the “mobile itinerary card” health tracking function planned for the following day.

The system, which is separate from the health code scanning system still required in a reduced number of places in China, had used people’s cell phone data to track their travel history in the past 14 days in an attempt to identify those who have been to a city with zones designated “high-risk” by authorities.

It had been a point of contention for many Chinese people, including due to concerns around data collection and its use by local governments to ban entry to those who have visited a city with a “high-risk zone,” even if they did not go to those areas within that city.

But as the scrapping of parts of the zero-Covid infrastructure come apace, there are questions about how the country’s health system will handle a mass outbreak.

Throughout the weekend, some businesses were closed in Beijing, and city streets were largely deserted, as residents either fell ill or feared catching the virus. The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.

Media outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary. Health workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.

The daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.

Covid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.

“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.

Changes, and concerns
The rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.

Authorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.

One note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.” The country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.

Last Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.

Outside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.

While Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.

Zhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.

Health authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.

Measures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.

‘Over-hyping’
Meanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.

Bob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.

“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.

There are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.

China’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.

A hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.

“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/china/china-zero-covid-impact-beijing-intl-hnk-mic
1;3 dead and foreign nationals injured after gunmen attack Kabul hotel;"Three people were killed and many others injured after gunmen attacked a hotel in Kabul, the Afghan capital, on Monday.

The attack started around 2:30 p.m. local time in Kabul’s commercial Shar-e-Naw area, with civilians in the building, according to police chief spokesman Khalid Zadran.

An eyewitness who lived nearby told CNN he saw a gunfight break out after gunmen attacked the hotel.

Police sent security forces to the scene, launching an operation to clear the area. The attack ended with all three gunmen killed and hotel guests safely evacuated, according to a tweet from Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahid on Monday.

Mojahid added that no foreign nationals were killed, but two foreign nationals were wounded after jumping from the rooftop.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday that five Chinese nationals were among the injured.

Videos posted on Twitter by a journalist in Kabul and verified by Reuters showed smoke billowing out of one of the floors amid sounds of gunshots, while a person was seen trying to escape the attack by jumping out of a hotel window.

Afterward, an emergency non-profit in Kabul tweeted that it received 21 casualties at their hospital located near the attack, including three who were dead on arrival – separate from the three attackers killed.

The attack came a day after China’s ambassador met the Afghan deputy foreign minister to discuss security-related matters and sought more attention on the protection of its embassy.

China’s state-run Xinhua news agency said the attack happened near a Chinese guesthouse and its embassy in Kabul was closely monitoring the situation.

1;Police officers among 6 killed in rural Australia gun battle;"Sydney
CNN
 — 
Two police officers were shot dead in an ambush outside a house in rural northeast Australia Monday, sparking an hours-long gun battle that ended with the deaths of all three suspected shooters, Queensland police said.

Police named the two slain officers as Constable Matthew Arnold, 29, and Constable Rachel McCrow, 26. A 58-year-old civilian bystander was also killed in the incident, police said.

Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll on Tuesday said four police officers had gone to the remote property in Wieambilla, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) northwest of Brisbane, during a search for a missing person – later identified as 46-year-old Nathaniel Train, according to New South Wales authorities.

When they arrived, they were “ambushed” by three shooters, Carroll said. Arnold and McCrow died instantly from gunshot wounds, while the other two officers were later taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

“In my opinion those two officers did not stand a chance. The fact that two got out alive is a miracle,” Carroll said.

A total of 16 general duty police officers responded to scene to retrieve the officers’ bodies under fire, police said.

A police Special Emergency Response Team then exchanged fire with the suspects during a four-hour-long gun battle that ended with the deaths of the suspected shooters police said.

“There was considerable weaponry involved in what took place,” Carroll said.

Train, a former school principal who was declared missing by New South Wales Police on December 8, was one of the suspects shot dead, police said. CNN affiliates Seven News and Nine News reported that the other two suspects killed were Train’s brother and his wife.

“One of the deceased was a former NSW Education employee who had not been working at a NSW school since August 2021. He officially left our employment in March this year,” the NSW education department said in a statement Tuesday.

Speaking Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said “all Australians this morning will be mourning with the family of the police officers who’ve lost their lives in the line of duty and others who’ve been injured.”

“Police put their lives on the line for their fellow Australians each and every day, and this tragic news will be heartfelt around the country,” he said.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/12/australia/queensland-australia-shootout-police-intl-hnk
1;Mark your calendar for the strongest meteor shower of the year;"CNN
 — 
The best chance to see the strongest meteor shower of the year is on its way this week.

The Geminids, known for bright, intensely colored meteors, have been streaking across the night sky since late November, and the shower will peak the night of December 13 through December 14, according to the American Meteor Society.

“If you had to pin one (meteor shower) as being the best of the year, year in and year out, it would be the Geminids,” said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the society. “Normally, from let’s say the suburban area, under good conditions, you could probably see 30 to 40 meteors (an hour).” With clear skies and no bright lights in the way, the Geminids can appear at a rate of about 120 visible meteors an hour, according to NASA. However, there is no escape from the big beacon in the sky that will obscure most of the fainter meteors this year: The moon will be shining at 72% fullness, according to the American Meteor Society.

“It is still going to be a good shower, even with the moon,” said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. “Find a decently dark sky, find something that will block the moon, maybe a building or a tree, and look away from the moon at the sky.”

Geminids’ growth
First observed in the mid-1800s, the shower initially delivered only 20 visible meteors per hour at maximum. Since then, the Geminids have reappeared every year, growing stronger in numbers. By the 1960s, the event had surpassed the substantial August Perseids, once the stronger shower with hourly rates of 50 to 100 meteors.

It is unclear how the Geminids might change in the foreseeable future, Cooke said, with some models indicating the shower will increase in intensity and others estimating a gradual decline over the next few decades. The Geminids are unique in that their source is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, while most other meteor showers are born out of debris from icy comets. That’s why Geminids streams can be unpredictable — because it is more difficult to model asteroid breakups, Cooke said.

The asteroid 3200 Phaethon is unusual in its own right, behaving like a comet when it nears the sun. It also has an orbit, which it completes every 1.4 years or so, that’s closer to the sun than any other asteroid. When 3200 Phaethon is near Earth, the asteroid sheds its dusty debris, hence the Geminids display.

How to see Geminids meteors
The Geminids are active from November 19 to December 24, according to EarthSky, but their hourly rates don’t start reaching double digits until December 10, Lunsford said.

The shower is known for being family friendly and a good one for young viewers in North America to observe since it’s the only major shower that exhibits the most activity before midnight. The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Gemini, which will rise in the sky at around 10 p.m. ET, Lunsford said.

“You can observe when the radiant is at its highest, which is between 1 a.m. and 2 (a.m. ET) with moonlight, or you can try viewing earlier in the evening when the moon is still below the horizon,” Lunsford said. “The rates will probably be fairly similar at those times, too.”  The Geminids will be viewable from all parts of the world, but for the Southern Hemisphere, it is best to view toward the middle of the night at 2 a.m. local time, since the radiant will need to be at its highest to be seen. The position of the radiant will be low on the horizon and will also cause the meteors to appear at a reduced rate, Lunsford said.

According to NASA’s meteor camera data, the Geminids shower is among the best for production of fireballs, meteors that are brighter than the planet Venus, second only to the Perseids, Cooke said. The biggest and brightest Geminids meteors are often said to appear greenish in color.

The moon’s Illumination has affected Geminids watching for the past two years, but the meteor shower is expected to occur around a new moon in 2023, creating perfect viewing conditions.

“When you see a meteor burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, you’re seeing something that’s been out in space for a very long time,” Cooke said. “From a scientific perspective, by studying it, we can learn something about what makes up those comets. To the casual observer, they’re a nice firework (display) — meteor showers are nature’s fireworks.”

The next and final major annual meteor shower of 2022 will be the Ursids, which peak the evening of December 22, according to EarthSky.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/world/geminids-meteor-shower-december-scn
0;The trains that changed the way we travel in 2022;"(CNN) — Everyone loves a good train ride, and in 2022 the world did rail fanatics proud with new routes, new operators and a new need for speed across the globe.
From a night train taking you from Austria to the Italian Riviera to the new semi high-speed line across Laos, from a luxurious trans-African odyssey to a new Swiss train that can ""jump"" rail tracks, and even the United States finally getting the thrill of the tracks, here are some of our favorite moments from the world of train travel.
Swiss supertrain A late debut, which entered service in December 2022, Switzerland's Golden Pass Express, or GPX as it's known, connects Montreux, Gstaad and Interlaken, with special panoramic trains that change height and wheel gauge to slip between the varying lines. The nearly four-hour trip sweeps past classic Swiss lakes and mountains. Previously the journey required two changes of trains.
Laos goes (semi) high-speed The big news in Laos this year was the semi high-speed train linking capital Vientiane with Boten, bordering China's Yunnan province. It runs via top visitor destinations like the karst-studded Vang Vieng, eco-tourism hub Luang Namtha, and Luang Prabang, the beautiful former royal capital. It's part of a wider plan to link Beijing to Bangkok and even Singapore over the next few decades.
Elizabeth Line transforms London Getting from Heathrow Airport into central London has long been a tiring hour-long Tube journey, an expensive taxi ride, or an equally pricey journey on the Heathrow Express train.
Not anymore -- the Elizabeth Line, which opened in May after $25 billion and a four year delay, connects Reading and Heathrow in the west with Abbey Wood in southeast London and Shenfield in Essex, east of the capital.
It's a quicker, smoother ride, with several stops in London itself. The last station, Bond Street, opened in November, along with through-routes from the west (initially passengers changed at Paddington). The final timetable will be introduced by May 2023.
Spain becomes Europe's competition hub What's better than one national high-speed rail network? Three of them. In November, Spain got (kind of) a fourth, with the launch of iryo -- a new high-speed competitor owned by major European players including Italian operator Trenitalia, which has brought its popular Frecciarossa trains to the line.
It's the third operator and the fourth high-speed brand for the country. Iryo is starting with Madrid to Barcelona via Zaragoza and Madrid to Valencia via Cuenca. Connections to Seville, Malaga, Cordoba and Antequera begin March 2023, with Alicante and Albacete in June. Hydrogen-powered trains show the way in Germany Not a new railway line but a new way to ride the rails -- Germany launched the world's first line to run entirely on hydrogen-powered trains in August. The line, in Bremerv?rde, Lower Saxony, carries 14 hydrogen trains powered by fuel cell propulsion.
Merged gradually with the existing diesel rolling stock, the hydrogen trains (the Coradia iLint model) were set to be entirely in place by the end of the year.
Hellenic Train arrives in Greece Italy's world-class trains have really spread out across Europe this year. Following the December 2021 launch of the Frecciarossa service from Milan to Paris, Trenitalia -- lead company of the Polo Passeggeri (passenger hub) of the Gruppo FS, Italy's publicly owned railways group -- launched a domestic French service between Paris and Lyon in April 2022.
Then, before setting up iryo, it headed over to Greece, where it launched Hellenic Train, a new Greek rail operator for passengers and freight. It's introduced electric trains on the busy Athens-Thessaloniki route -- the journey between Greece's two biggest cities takes just under four hours -- and also operates urban and suburban lines around the capital.
Thailand's temporary 'floating' train Rising water levels meant that in November, Thai passengers were able to ride along on a ""floating"" train across one of the country's biggest reservoirs.
Leaving Bangkok, the train heads into Lop Buri province, where the water has reached the very top of the Pasak Jolasid dam. Thoughtfully, the train even makes a stop once it hits the middle point, so passengers can jump out and snap selfies in this unexpected waterworld. The train is running until February, though by November tickets were already sold out through the New Year.
Italian express to beer country A late entry to the list, which launched December 11, ?BB's new night train whisks you from the snowy cities of Austria and Germany to the mild Italian Riviera, or vice versa.
Perhaps heading north is more fun -- starting from La Spezia (the jumping off point for the Cinque Terre), the train heads north up the coast of Liguria and calls at Genoa and Milan, before heading past Lake Garda to Verona, bidding farewell to Italy at Padova and hitting Austria at Villach. Here it divides into two -- one half ticks off Austria and Germany, calling at Salzburg at 6:49 a.m. before arriving at Munich at 9.20 a.m. while the other half stays in Austria, continuing to Vienna.
There was previously a Vienna-Milan night train -- the new route extends it beyond the Italian fashion capital.
A night in Scandinavia Sweden is the home of Europe's ""flight shame"" movement, and Swedish operator SJ has capitalized on that with its night train from Stockholm to Hamburg, which started in September under the name EuroNight. Departing around 5.30 p.m. from the Swedish capital, it has a long stop at Malm? before heading through Denmark, arriving in Hamburg before 7 a.m. America boards the rail revolution Let's be honest -- the US is way behind much of the world when it comes to train travel, so increasing the speed on a popular stretch is big news.
In June, Amtrak's infrastructure upgrades meant that its Acela trains can now run at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour in the relevant New Jersey section of the Northeast Corridor. Sure, that section is just 16 miles long, between New Brunswick and South Brunswick, but it's a fine start.
In 2023, also on the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak will debut next-generation Acela trains that are capable of speeds of up to 160mph, to replace older rolling stock.
An African odyssey
 One for those with time and money to spare: in July, Rovos Rail launched its new route, the Copper Trail, slicing through four countries of sub-Saharan Africa and covering nearly 2,000 miles on a hyper-lux train.
Starting at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, the 15-day luxury trip heads north through Zambia, then curls west through the DCR to Angola, where it ends at Lobito, on the Atlantic coast.
In between are day trips to national parks, an elephant sanctuary, and walking tours of towns and cities, including Huambo, Angola's second city. It is, of course, as breathtakingly expensive as it is beautiful -- prices for 2023 start at $13,600.
France: See the future More of a taste of the future rather than a real debut, in September French railway operator SNCF unveiled its next-generation high-speed train, the TGV M.

0;The best ski resorts where you can use your hotel points for a free stay;"Winter is here, and for many families, that means it’s time to break out the ski and snowboard gear and start thinking about a trip to the slopes. But it’s no secret that ski vacations can be costly. Fortunately, there’s one way to truly keep the cost down: using your travel rewards to cover the cost of your hotel

Plenty of chain hotels offer properties in the middle of ski towns, so there’s often no shortage of lodging opportunities. And even though many of these properties charge exorbitant rates during the winter vacation ski season, you’ll find that using your points can be a great deal.

Before you go ahead and book your next ski vacation, take a look to see if any travel rewards hotels are located in your desired destination. We’ve taken a look at the most popular Marriott Bonvoy, World of Hyatt and Hilton Honors properties where you can use your points to save big when hitting the slopes.

Marriott Bonvoy ski vacation hotels
Of the three major hotel chains in the US, Marriott has the largest number of properties catered toward ski vacations. So, if you want to have access to as many mountain properties as possible, accruing Marriott Bonvoy points is the way to go. The chain has a slew of properties in Colorado, but you’ll find that you can also redeem your points in Utah, California, Canada, Switzerland and beyond.

With Marriott Bonvoy’s dynamic pricing model, the number of points required for a free night is loosely tied to the cash rate. This also means that if you’re able to vacation during the shoulder season — before Christmas and at the end of March — you’ll often find that far fewer points are required for a free night.

How to earn Marriott Bonvoy points
Before diving into the ways to spend your points, you have to earn them. One of the easiest and fastest ways to earn Marriott Bonvoy points is to sign up for one of the chain’s Marriott-branded credit cards. Marriott credit cards offer a wide range of benefits, and with many, you can easily offset the annual fee. With the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card, you can earn 150,000 Bonvoy points after spending $5,000 within the first three months after account opening, which can score you a few free nights on your next ski vacation. Aside from earning points with one of the Marriott credit cards, Marriott Bonvoy is also a transfer partner of both Chase Ultimate Rewards and American Express Membership Rewards programs. Points transfer at a one-to-one rate from both Chase and Amex to Marriott, allowing you to top off an award if you are a few points shy.

With the Marriott Bonvoy program, you’ll also receive your fifth night free on award stays. This means for every five nights you stay at the same property, the lowest-cost night during your stay will be free.

The St. Regis Residence Club Aspen — Aspen, Colorado If you’re aiming for luxury with an elegant yet modern feel, you can’t go wrong with The St. Regis Residence Club Aspen for your ski vacation. With custom furniture designed by Ralph Lauren and marble bathrooms in the rooms, you’ll never have to leave. But, you’ll want to leave to check out all there is to see nearby. The property is centrally located and just a short walk from ski lifts as well as many stores and restaurants. After a long day of skiing, you can soak in the outdoor pool and hot tub. The hotel also features two onsite restaurants and a bar. And when you’re ready to hang up your skis for the day, enjoy a visit to the spa or steam room.

Points required: From 90,000 to 120,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.

W Aspen — Aspen, Colorado Located right in the middle of all the fun in Aspen, this relatively new property is just a short walk to the slopes. With a more lively vibe than The St. Regis just down the street, you’ll have access to a rooftop pool, hot tub, fire pit and bar. Some of the room layouts at the W Aspen are slightly more funky than what you might be used to, offering rooms with a queen-over-queen bunk bed or even two queen beds in a head-to-toe arrangement.

Points required: From 79,000 to 103,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.

Viewline Resort Snowmass, Autograph Collection — Snowmass Village, Colorado Previously known as The Westin Snowmass Resort, the Viewline Resort Snowmass is a true ski-in/ski-out property. Just strap on your skis or snowboard and you can be on the slopes in no time. And if you’re new to skiing, the gondola right outside of the hotel will take you to the base of the mountain where you can meet your ski school group. Although the hotel is approximately 20 minutes away from Aspen, newbies will prefer the more beginner and intermediate terrain of Snowmass. The resort might not be as fancy as some other hotels in the vicinity, but it still offers a heated pool, hot tub and fitness center.

Points required: From 49,000 to 63,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.

The Hythe Vail, a Luxury Collection Resort — Vail, Colorado After a $40 million renovation and a name change, this upscale resort is an ideal destination for your next ski vacation. Although The Hythe Vail is not a true ski-in/ski-out property, the hotel is just a quick walk to nearby lifts, restaurants, shops and an outdoor ice-skating rink. And after a long day of skiing, families will love the hot chocolate bar and complimentary s’mores.

When using points, you have the option of a king bed or two double beds. To book yourself into a room with two queen beds — an admittedly more comfortable sleeping situation — you’ll have to pay an upgrade fee or redeem additional points. Alternatively, larger suites are also available for an additional fee.

Points required: From 79,000 to 106,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.

The Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch — Avon, Colorado This massive resort is at the base of the Bachelor Gulch side of the mountain, giving you a relaxing ski-in/ski-out experience. By staying at The Ritz Carlton, Bachelor Gulch, you’ll also be perfectly situated near the new McCoy Park terrain, which offers 17 trails for beginner and intermediate skiers.

While the location of the property gives you a quieter vacation experience, you are slightly removed from the conveniences of ski school and Beaver Creek Village. At the property, you’ll have access to three onsite restaurants plus a bar, lounge, outdoor heated pool, fitness center and ski valet.

Points required: From 84,000 to 120,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.";https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/travel/how-to-use-points-ski-vacation
0;'Bali tourism will not be affected by new criminal code,' Indonesian officials say;"Jakarta/Hong Kong (CNN) — Indonesia's controversial sex laws will not affect foreign tourists visiting Bali, officials have confirmed in a statement issued Monday.
""Based on the provisions of the new Indonesian criminal code, visitors who visit or live in Bali would not need to worry,"" said Balinese governor Wayan Koster, adding that there would be ""no checks on marital statuses at tourist accommodations like hotels, villas, guest houses or spas, or inspections by public officials or community groups.""
Like most major tourism hotspots around the world, Bali suffered vast economic turmoil during the Covid-19 pandemic. International travelers have been returning to the popular resort island as the pandemic subsides, but industry players previously told CNN that the country's new criminal code could put foreigners off visiting and hurt the country's global reputation.
Indonesian lawmakers on Tuesday added controversial new laws to its colonial-era criminal code, which sparked global concerns about rights and privacy in the Southeast Asian country.  Wayan was addressing questions from the public on how laws governing sex and marriage included in the new code would affect international travelers.
""Bali is (business) as usual -- comfortable and safe to visit,"" he said. ""We look forward to welcoming visitors with our Balinese hospitality and advise all parties not to deliver misleading statements regarding the Indonesian criminal code that might disrupt Bali tourism,"" he added.
His words also followed an official clarification from government spokesperson Albert Aries last week, who said that foreign investors and travelers ""did not have to worry"" about persecution by the laws. ""People's privacy is still guaranteed by law so there's really nothing to worry about, "" he said.
""The new Criminal Code has also never provided additional administrative requirements for business actors in the tourism sector to ask anyone about their marital status."" Officials previously said that the new code -- which bans adultery, cohabitation before marriage and apostasy -- would also apply to foreign residents and tourists.
It's safe to say that tourists in Bali will not be affected by the new laws. But for hundreds of millions of Indonesians, the reality on the ground remains worrying.
""For decades now, Indonesia has enjoyed a reputation as a pluralistic democracy, with very little religious, ethnic, or political conflict, given its size and cultural diversity,"" said Rebekah Moore, a professor at Northeastern University and co-founder of Bersama Project, an Indonesian arts and culture nonprofit.
Many groups like activists, journalists, religious minorities and members of the queer community are still at risk and will be harmed by this new code, Moore added.
""The provisions could impact any Indonesian exercising freedom of expression,"" she said. ""I observed firsthand what happens when extremists (in Indonesia) are emboldened by the political and media mainstream and am deeply concerned for queer and activist friends and others.""";https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/bali-tourism-indonesia-criminal-code-intl-hnk
0;Palestinians relive the raw and painful history of al-Nakba in Netflix's new film 'Farha';"
On a warm evening last week, Leila Giries sat in her California home, took a deep breath and pressed play on a film she says forced her to relive the most traumatic moment of her life.
""Farha,"" released December 1 on Netflix, is inspired by the story of a young Palestinian girl and the violence she witnessed during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups in what Palestinians have since called al-Nakba or ""the catastrophe.""
As the groups invaded Farha's village, her father locked her in a pantry for safety, where she watched the horrors of al-Nakba unfold through a small hole in the wall and crack in the door. As days passed, she was transformed from a spirited 14-year-old who dreamed of going to school into a shell of her former self.
""My kids were watching it at the same time, and when they asked me what I thought, I couldn't answer them because of how hard I was crying,"" said Giries, an 82-year-old Palestinian refugee who survived the war.
""All I could say was, 'That's me. Farha is me. That's me in that room,'"" she said, her voice cracking as tears threatened to return.
""Farha"" is based on the experience of a Palestinian girl named Radieh, the film's Palestinian-Jordanian director Darin J. Sallam told CNN at a film screening on Friday in New York City. Radieh survived the war and found refuge in Syria, where she shared her story with a girl she met there. That girl later became Sallam's mother. Through ""Farha,"" Sallam hopes Radieh's story will continue to be shared and ""live on in people's hearts.""
The film, selected as Jordan's 2023 Oscars entry, has been celebrated the world over for portraying al-Nakba so vividly, as well as offering a perspective on the events that led to Israel's founding that is rarely seen or heard on a global mainstream platform. ""I created 'Farha' because I wanted my audience to watch the film and think with their feelings, not their minds. I wanted people to invest emotionally in the story. I wanted people to feel, and live in the experience of Farha, to experience what she experienced, feel what she felt, hear what she heard, like those who survived the Nakba did,"" Sallam said.
But like most accounts of the 1948 war, the film has also been met with criticism and controversy.
Attempts at censorship
Days before ""Farha"" was released on Netflix, Israelis and their supporters shared videos on social media of themselves unsubscribing from the movie streaming service. Others spammed online film database IMDb with negative reviews despite not having watched it. They called it inaccurate and hateful, among other disparaging remarks.
""It's crazy that Netflix has chosen to stream a film whose whole purpose is to incite against Israeli soldiers by showing false things,"" Israeli Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman said about ""Farha"" on Twitter before its release. ""Israel is a place where you can show local and international content but not content that talks against Israeli soldiers and spreads lies about them.""
Neither Netflix nor IMDb responded to CNN's request for comment, and the film remains available for streaming.
Al Saraya Theatre, which screened ""Farha"" in Jaffa, Israel, was also met with outrage, including protestors who attempted to stop the screening, as seen in videos theater manager Mahmoud Abo Arisheh shared with CNN.
Liberman, head of the center-right political party Yisrael Beiteinu, and Israeli Culture Minister Chili Tropper slammed the theater and called for it to lose government funding.
Despite the threats, Abo Arisheh, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, told CNN they chose to proceed with the screening because of the ""responsibility to make sure that art in all its forms is accessible to our people, even if not everybody agrees with the content.""
Abo Arisheh also praised Netflix for not removing ""Farha"" from its website. ""People have the right to choose what to watch and what not to,"" he said.  In a statement posted to the film's Instagram page on December 1, Sallam and the film's producers, Deema Azar and Ayah Jardaneh, denounced what they described as attempts to ""silence"" Palestinian voices and ""dehumanize us and prevent us from telling our stories, our narrative and our truth.""
Many Israelis deny the events of al-Nakba because it cuts to the heart of Israel's founding, said Julia Bacha, creative director for Just Vision, a nonprofit media group comprised of Israelis, Palestinians and others who envision a ""pluralistic, just and rights-respecting future in the region.""
""Bringing the nation's dark past into the public discourse could weaken the pristine image that patriots hope to project,"" Bacha said. ""Perhaps worse, it could delegitimize the very foundations on which the nation stands.""
What Palestinians refer to as ""the catastrophe,"" Israelis celebrate as their battle for independence. Attempts to censor ""Farha"" should be viewed as ""efforts to control the narrative of uncomfortable truths,"" she said.
Stefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, a US-based activist group, says showing the film could actually help Israelis come to terms with their history. ""'Farha' is a beautiful, hard and important film, and it should be required viewing in synagogues and Jewish community centers,"" she said. ""There are few topics so difficult within Jewish community -- or so important for us to reckon with -- than understanding the real truth about the nature and founding of the state of Israel.""
'Everyone needs to see 'Farha''
Not a day goes by that Giries doesn't wonder what life would have been like if her family was not forced to leave their home in Ein Karem, now part of Jerusalem.
""When I went back 37 years later, I realized I remembered every single house and building that used to be there,"" Giries said. ""That's how many times I traveled to Palestine in my mind, every single day, wanting to go back home.""
She still has the bag her mother grabbed for her as they ran for their lives while the village burned, she said. It's framed and hanging on a wall in her California home, alongside the key to her family's Palestinian home, which was reduced to rubble.  Like most Palestinian refugees, Giries is forbidden from returning to live in Israel. Many Palestinian refugees and their descendants -- which the United Nations says now number 5 million people -- live in UN camps established in neighboring countries. Others are internally displaced throughout the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
Mahmoud Salah, another survivor of al-Nakba, said the violence depicted in ""Farha"" was eerily similar to what he saw as he fled from the Palestinian village of Sar'a. After his family was expelled, they traveled by foot for six months, sheltering in caves and under trees as they searched for food and safety. He remembers every detail of that journey, from flyers dropped from airplanes urging Palestinians to flee, to the screams of villagers who lost loved ones. To this day, Salah says he still thinks about life before al-Nakba, memories vivid with the beautiful colors of his homeland. ""Since the day we were forced to leave, my eyes have been searching, searching for my village, for the books I left behind, for what of mine has been taken and destroyed,"" Salah, 90, told CNN from his home in Orland Park, a suburb of Chicago.
He said having his experience denied for so long only added to the pain and anger. ""That feeling of being forced out of our home, our country, will never leave us. I don't believe in Orland Park. I believe in Jerusalem. I believe in Palestine,"" Salah said.
For refugees like Giries and Salah, ""Farha"" is validation of their experience.
""I'm a product of the Nakba. My parents and grandparents are a product of the Nakba... you cannot deny our existence,"" Giries said.
""Everyone needs to see 'Farha,' because it is not a fictional story of this girl, it is my story, it is the Palestinian story,"" she added. ""We don't care who tells us it isn't true. We lived it and our stories need to be heard because the injustic";https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/farha-palestinian-film-nakba-darin-sallam-reaj
0;Treasures from the Silk Road are revealed at Louvre exhibition of Uzbek art;"Pages from of one of the oldest Qurans in existence, and a painting described as Uzbekistan's ""Mona Lisa,"" are among the historic treasures on show at a new exhibition at the Louvre Museum in Paris.
""The Splendours of Uzbekistan's Oases"" features more than 170 works offering a glimpse into the country's past, including celebrated wall paintings, Buddhist sculptures and everyday items belonging to ancient civilizations.
The exhibition is co-curated by archeologist Rocco Rante, who has been excavating since 2009 in Uzbekistan's Bukhara Oasis. The area was once a prominent stop on the Silk Road trade route which passed through present-day Uzbekistan hundreds of years ago, connecting the Mediterranean to the Far East.
The star attraction is two pages from the Katta Langar Quran, one of the world's oldest surviving Quran manuscripts, dating to the early days of Islam. It was conserved for centuries in a mausoleum in a small village perched on a mountaintop.
""With the help and support of our Uzbek colleagues, we brought to light and restored one of the most ancient Qurans from the 8th century, which is a huge discovery,"" Rante said. The exhibition, created in partnership between the Louvre Museum and the Uzbekistan's Art and Culture Development Foundation, takes visitors on a political and historical journey of Uzbek life across 1,600 years, starting from the first century BC.
According to Yannick Lintz, co-curator and former director of Islamic Art at the Louvre, the Silk Road is at the heart of the exhibition, which spotlights relics found along its caravan routes.
""Everyone knows that those roads were for economic exchanges between east and west, but they were also intellectual, artistical and technological roads,"" said Lintz.
Lintz hopes to transport people back in time with treasures from the periods of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Amir Timur (also known as Tamerlane), who founded a vast Central Asian empire in the 14th century.
""It was important for me to show the visitors that we can have cultural, religious and artistic dialogues in this part of the world between China, India and Iran, because Uzbekistan is in the middle,"" Lintz added.
Treasures brought to light
Together with experts from Uzbekistan, the Louvre conducted large-scale restoration works on many of the exhibits. Among the objects to be restored was the door of G?r-i Am?r from the 14th Century originating from Tamerlane's mausoleum in Samarkand, a city in southeastern Uzbekistan.
""In the door, we found large iconography representing the society of Samarkand. We found details in the center of the door where the divinity is sculpted. All around, you can see different figures offering something to this god,"" Rante said.
Uzbek paintings were also preserved, including monumental murals of the princely residence of Varakhsha, dating back to the 4th century. Located in the northwest of the Bukhara Oasis, the town of Varakhsha was once occupied by the Sogdians, an ancient people who lived on the Silk Road. Also on display is the renowned 8th Century Sogdian fresco known as ""The Painting of the Ambassadors,"" accompanied by a series of wall paintings depicting the ancient city of Afrasiab. Parts of ""The Painting of the Ambassadors,"" are missing, and its meaning is only partly understood, but it is nonetheless regarded as a masterpiece.
""The Ambassadors painting is a national treasure for the Uzbek people,"" Lintz said. ""What I call the Uzbek Mona.""

0;What to know about Lensa, the AI portrait app all over social media;"
Zoe Sottile, CNN
If you've logged on to any social media app this week, you've probably seen pictures of your friends, but re-imagined as fairy princesses, anim? characters, or celestial beings.
It is all because of Lensa, an app which uses artificial intelligence to render digital portraits based on photos users submit.
Lensa's highly stylized, eye-catching portraits have taken over the internet, but they have also been the subject of concern from privacy experts, digital artists, and users who have noticed the app making their skin paler or their bodies thinner.
Here's everything you need to know about Lensa: How to get your own 'magic avatar'
The pictures making the rounds online are products of Lensa's ""Magic Avatars"" function. To try it out, you'll need to first download the Lensa app on your phone.
A yearlong subscription to the app, which also provides photo editing services, costs $35.99. But you can use the app for a weeklong free trial if you want to test it out before committing.
Generating the magic avatars requires an additional fee. As long as you have a subscription or free trial, you can get 50 avatars for $3.99, 100 for $5.99, or 200 for $7.99.
Lensa recommends users submit 10-20 selfies for the best results. The pictures should be close-up of your face with a variety of different backgrounds, facial expressions, and angles. Lensa also stipulates it should only be used by people who are 13 and older.
Lensa is a product of Prisma, which first reached popularity in 2016 with a function allowing users to transform their selfies into images in the style of famous artists.
The app explains in its privacy policy they use TrueDepth API technology, and the user-provided photos, or ""face data,"" are used ""to train our algorithms to perform better and show you better results.""
We tested out the app to see what it's like
To test out the app, I curated 20 selfies I thought showed off a variety of expressions and angles and chose the 100 avatar option. It took around 20 minutes for Lensa to return my avatars, which fell into 10 categories: fantasy, fairy princess, focus, pop, stylish, anim?, light, kawaii, iridescent, and cosmic.
In general, I felt like the app did a decent job producing artistic images based on my selfies. I couldn't quite recognize myself in most of the portraits, but I could see where they were coming from.
It seemed to recognize and repeat certain features, like my pale skin or my round nose, more than others. Some of them were in a more realistic style, and were close enough I might think they were actually photos of me if I saw them from afar. Others were significantly more stylized and artistic, so they felt less specific to me.
For some women, the app produces sexualized images
One of the challenges I encountered in the app has been described by other women online. Even though all the images I uploaded were fully-clothed and mostly close-ups of my face, the app returned several images with implied or actual nudity.
In one of the most disorienting images, it looked like a version of my face was on a naked body. In several photos, it looked like I was naked but with a blanket strategically placed, or the image just cut off to hide anything explicit. And many of the images, even where I was fully clothed, featured a sultry facial expression, significant cleavage, and skimpy clothing which did not match the photos I had submitted.
This was surprising, but I'm not the only woman who experienced it. Olivia Snow, a research fellow at UCLA's center for critical internet inquiry and professional dominatrix, told CNN the app returned nude images in her likeness even when she submitted pictures of herself as a child, an experience she documented for WIRED.
Snow said artificial intelligence technology like the one Lensa uses could be used to generate ""revenge porn,"" i.e., making naked images of someone without their consent.
For Snow, the output was a sign of the ""complete lack of content moderation"" on the app. She also called for greater regulation of AI apps like Lensa.
Lensa did not reply to a request from CNN to comment on the app producing nude or sexualized images.
Other users have documented different forms of bias produced in their Lensa images, like Black users who are ""whitewashed"" and shown as paler than they actually are. Similarly, Aubrey Gordon, a writer and fat rights activist, wrote on her verified Instagram the app produced images which made her look much thinner than she actually is.
""Lensa is really working overtime to make AI me into a thin person,"" she wrote in the caption. Digital artists say the app co-opts their work
Lensa's technology relies on a deep learning model called Stable Diffusion, according to its privacy policy. Stable Diffusion uses a massive network of digital art scraped from the internet, from a database called LAION-5B, to train its artificial intelligence. Currently, artists are unable to opt-in or opt-out of having their art included in the data set and thus used to train the algorithm.
It has raised concerns from some artists, who say Stable Diffusion relies on their artwork to make their own images, but they are not credited or compensated for their work. Earlier this year, CNN reported on several artists who were upset when they found their work had been used without their consent or payment to train the neural network for Stable Diffusion.
Several of the artists expressed concern the apps could also threaten their livelihoods. Digital artists cannot compete with the low prices and fast turnaround artificial intelligence enables for a digital portrait, they said at the time.
Lensa's owner Prisma has tried to assuage concerns about their technology eliminating work for digital artists.
""Whilst both humans and AI learn about artistic styles in semi-similar ways, there are some fundamental differences: AI is capable of rapidly analyzing and learning from large sets of data, but it does not have the same level of attention and appreciation for art as a human being,"" wrote the company on Twitter on December 6.
And ""the outputs can't be described as exact replicas of any particular artwork.""";https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/lensa-ai-app-art-explainer-trnd
0;A Ukrainian photographer's love letter to his homeland;"In a drone photograph by Yevhen Samuchenko, Lake Lemuria, the so-called ""Dead Sea of Ukraine,"" takes on a surreal, otherworldly quality. Its waters turned pink by algae, its shoreline streaked with white salt deposits, the body of water might easily be confused for an abstract painting were it not for the presence of two tiny figures and their nearby car. ""I wanted to show the scale of the landscape, because when you see the very small people, you understand how big the location is,"" said Samuchenko, via a translator, on a video call from his home in the Ukrainian city of Odesa. ""But I also want the viewer to see themselves as being like these people — to invite them into the photo.""
The photographer's mission to showcase Ukraine's natural beauty has taken on new urgency following Russia's full-scale invasion in February. Since Samuchenko captured the image, titled ""White Car & Two People,"" in 2019, the region in which the lake is located, Kherson Oblast, has been partially occupied by Vladimir Putin's forces. When Samuchenko visited, however, the lake was a peaceful spot — one reachable only via ""very bad roads"" and with very little tourist infrastructure, he explained. The figures standing face-to-face in the image are two of Samuchenko's fellow photographers, though he says the moment shared by his two friends was spontaneous, not posed. ""White Car & Two People"" has since been shortlisted for the prestigious Earth Photo 2022 competition, while the photographer's wider series on Lake Lemuria, titled ""At the Pink Planet,"" has been recognized by Sony World Photography Awards and Travel Photographer of the Year competitions.
'My frontline'
Samuchenko recently donated his drone to the Ukrainian military, and he says it is currently impossible for him to operate as a photographer. But in a conflict that may hinge on the support of sympathetic allies, he hopes his work can still contribute to the war effort by appealing to hearts and minds. ""It's my frontline,"" he said. Over the summer, Samuchenko published a book featuring almost 150 of his photos, including many from regions devastated by conflict, such as Mykolaiv and Zhytomyr Oblasts. ""The Beauty of Ukraine,"" which was shot over the course of two years, acts as a survey of the country's vast and varied geography, spanning both natural and man-made landscapes.
Like his images of Lake Lemuria, the painterly photos reveal hidden symmetries, patterns and shapes. Canyons, riverbeds, forests and farmland burst with color and take on a surreal new beauty when viewed from above. Samuchenko's book was already in production when the war began. Some of the places depicted have since been damaged, according to author Lucia Bondar, who wrote the accompanying text.
""Even nature has suffered because of this terrible war,"" she said, adding: ""It's very important to show the world now the other side of Ukraine. Every day, the whole planet sees these dramatic pictures on their screens, in real time. They see this pain and these tears...

0;Storms with possible tornadoes rake Oklahoma and Texas – injuring at least 7 – as blizzard conditions mount in the northern Plains;"Severe storms including suspected tornadoes have carved paths of destruction in Oklahoma and the Dallas-Fort Worth area Tuesday and injured at least seven people – part of a larger storm system that threatens more damage in the South and blizzard conditions in states farther north.

The giant winter storm system is pushing through the central US after walloping the West. About 21 million people from Texas to Mississippi are under threat of severe storms Tuesday, including tornadoes. And about 14 million people – largely in the north-central US – are under winter-weather warnings or advisories Tuesday, with blowing snow and power outages a key concern.

A tornado watch is in effect for parts of Arkansas, southeastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas until 5 p.m. CT. Damage on Tuesday includes:

• Grapevine, Texas: At least one tornado was reported in this city just outside Dallas Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service said, and storms left at least five people there injured, Grapevine police said. Details about the injuries weren’t immediately available.

Businesses including a Grapevine mall, a Sam’s Club and a Walmart were damaged, police said. A gas station was destroyed, and drivers on one road were forced to share a single lane because downed trees and other debris blocked parts of the thoroughfare, motorist Claudio Ropain David told CNN.

• Elsewhere outside Dallas: At least two people were injured, and homes and businesses were damaged, as severe weather hit east of Paradise and south of Decatur in Wise County on Tuesday morning, northwest of Fort Worth, county officials said.

One person was hurt when wind overturned their vehicle, and the other – also in a vehicle – was hurt by flying debris, the Wise County emergency management office said. One was taken to a hospital, the office said without elaborating. High winds also damaged homes and trees near Callisburg north of Dallas, blew over tractor-trailers near the towns of Millsap and Weatherford; and damaged barns near the town of Jacksboro, the National Weather Service said.

• Wayne, Oklahoma: A suspected tornado in that town knocked out power and damaged homes, outbuildings and barns early Tuesday, officials said, adding no injuries were reported. Homes were flattened or had roofs torn off, and trees were snapped like twigs, video from CNN affiliate KOCO showed.

More severe storms capable of tornadoes, as well as hail and damaging winds are expected Tuesday and Wednesday in the Gulf Coast region as the complex snow-or-rain system sweeps through the central US from north to south.

 Blizzard and ice warnings in the north-central US
Across the central and northern Plains and Upper Midwest, heavy, blowing snow and/or freezing rain into Thursday could snarl travel and threaten power outages.

Blizzard warnings – forecasting at least three hours of sustained winds or frequent gusts at 35 mph or greater during considerable snowfall and poor visibility – extended Tuesday from parts of Montana and Wyoming into northeastern Colorado, western Nebraska and South Dakota.

Blizzard conditions were being reported in the morning and early afternoon near the Colorado-Kansas state line. Visibility along Interstate 70 in that area was down to 100 feet, a Kansas Highway Patrol spokesman said on Twitter.

Snowfall through Wednesday morning generally could be 10 to 18 inches in the central and northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Some areas inside the blizzard warning zones – particularly western South Dakota, eastern Wyoming and northwestern Nebraska – could get as many as 24 inches of snow, with winds strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages, the Weather Prediction Center said. In Sidney, Nebraska, winds whipped Tuesday morning at 53 mph, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said, “and then you add in the snow, visibility is a quarter mile.”

Interstates in South Dakota could become impassable amid the blizzard conditions, resulting in roadway closures across the state, the South Dakota Department of Transportation warned Monday. Ice storm warnings were issued for parts of eastern South Dakota, southwestern Minnesota and western Iowa. Up to two-tenths of an inch of ice could accumulate in some of these areas, forecasters said.

Wintry precipitation “will begin to spread eastward over the Upper Great Lakes late Tuesday and Wednesday and into the Northeast late Wednesday as the storm system continues eastward,” the prediction center said.

Freezing rain and sleet, meanwhile, will be possible through Wednesday in the Upper Midwest.

More tornadoes are a threat on the storm’s southern end
Meanwhile, the southern end of the storm threatens to bring more tornadoes. An alert for enhanced risk of severe weather – level 3 of 5 – was issued Tuesday for eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi River Valley, with the main threats including powerful tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail. Baton Rouge, Shreveport, and Lafayette, Louisiana, are part of the threatened area, as is Jackson, Mississippi.

“My main concern with the tornadoes is going to be after dark,” Myers said Tuesday. “We have very short days this time of year, so 5 or 6 o’clock, it’s going to be dark out there. Spotters aren’t as accurate when it is dark. Tornado warnings are a little bit slow; if you’re sleeping, you may not get them. So, that’s the real danger with this storm.” A zone of slight risk – level 2 of 5 – encircled that area, stretching from eastern Texas and southern Oklahoma to southern Arkansas and much of the rest of Louisiana, including New Orleans, and central Mississippi.

Tuesday also brings a slight risk of excessive rainfall in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, with 2 to 4 inches of rain and flash flooding possible, the Weather Prediction Center said.

On Wednesday, the threat for severe weather is largely focused on the Gulf Coast, with tornadoes and damaging winds possible over parts of southern Louisiana, Mississippi, southwest Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/weather/nationwide-winter-storm-blizzard-Tuesday
0;Tsunamis Fast Facts;"Here is a look at tsunamis.

Tsunamis are formed by a displacement of water - a landslide, earthquake, volcanic eruption, or slippage of the boundary between two of the earth’s tectonic plates - slabs of rock 50 to 650 feet (15 to 200 meters) thick that carry the Earth’s continents and seas on an underground ocean of much hotter, semi-solid material.

Tsunamis can travel more than 500 mph (800 k/ph) at the deepest point of the water, but slow as they near the shore, eventually hitting the shore at 20 to 30 mph (32 to 48 k/ph). The energy of the wave’s speed is transferred to height and sheer force as it nears shore.

Major or Notable Tsunamis
November 1, 1755 - An estimated 60,000 people are killed when an earthquake strikes Lisbon, Portugal, and causes a tsunami.

August 27, 1883 - An estimated 36,000 people are killed when the Krakatau volcano erupts, causing a tsunami in the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra.

June 15, 1896 - An estimated 28,000 people are killed when an 8.5-magnitude earthquake strikes Sanriku, Japan, causing a tsunami.

December 28, 1908 - An estimated 70,000-100,000 people are killed when a 7.2-magnitude earthquake strikes Messina, Italy, and causes a tsunami in the Straights of Messina.

May 22, 1960 - An estimated 1,500 people are killed when a magnitude 9.5 earthquake strikes Chile and causes a tsunami.

March 28, 1964 - An estimated 128 people are killed when a magnitude 9.2 earthquake strikes Prince William Sound, Alaska, and causes a tsunami.

August 16, 1976 - An estimated 4,000-8,000 people are killed when an 8.0-magnitude earthquake strikes the Philippines and causes a tsunami.

July 17, 1998 - An estimated 2,200 people are killed when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake strikes Papua New Guinea and causes a tsunami.

December 26, 2004 - An estimated 227,898 people are killed when a 9.1-magnitude earthquake strikes near Sumatra, Indonesia, and causes a subsequent tsunami in 14 countries in South Asia and East Africa.

October 25, 2010 - An estimated 449 people are killed when a magnitude 7.7 earthquake strikes Indonesia and causes a tsunami.

March 11, 2011 - A 9.1-magnitude earthquake takes place 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. The earthquake causes a tsunami with 30 ft waves that damage several nuclear reactors in the area. The combined total of confirmed deaths and missing is more than 22,000 (nearly 20,000 deaths and 2,500 missing). (Source: Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency)

September 28, 2018 - More than 4,140 people are killed when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake strikes the Indonesian island of Sulawesi and causes a tsunami.

December 22, 2018 - A tsunami with waves as high as three meters hits Pandeglang, Serang and South Lampung, Indonesia, leaving more than 437 people dead, 16 missing and 16,198 displaced. Officials believe the tsunami was caused by a series of underwater landslides triggered by a volcanic eruption.";https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/20/world/tsunamis-fast-facts
0;'Houses That Can Save the World': These homes offer a blueprint for a greener future;"It's an uncomfortable truth, but many of our houses are bad for the planet. They're defined by a pattern of consumption, from the raw materials to build them, to the fuel required to sustain them, and the waste generated by them.
Despite an improvement in building energy efficiency, 2021 saw carbon emissions from building and construction hit an all-time high.
But what if a house could nurture the people living inside and the world outside too? What if a house could feed its occupants? Power itself? Boost biodiversity? Bond a community? And at the end of its life, leave no trace?
It would be ambitious to expect one house to do all that. But as demonstrated by a recently published book, many are being designed to promote a more equitable, more sustainable way of living.
Authored by Courtney Smith and Sean Topham, ""Houses That Can Save the World"" features over 150 projects -- some concepts, the majority built -- from all over the globe. Some repurpose existing spaces, such as Ensamble Studio's off-grid cave dwelling in Menorca, Spain. Others revive and update ancient construction methods, like ZAV Architects' adobe building community in Hormuz, Iran.
Then there are those employing cutting-edge technologies, including ICON's 3-D printed homes, which have already been constructed in North America. In November, ICON announced it had been awarded a $57 million contract by NASA to develop a construction system for the lunar surface. Grouped into 19 themes including ""Breathe,"" ""Dig"" and ""Float,"" the projects' variety and scope is evidence there is no one-size-fits-all house for the challenges of the 21st Century.
""We found lots of people doing lots of really innovative things and doing things differently on a local level,"" Topham says.
Smith says focusing on the local -- from building materials to construction techniques -- is a throughline of the book, and a counterpoint to prevailing attitudes in the construction industry.
The author says that 20th Century modernist design has spread, and as people have become more affluent, they have either expected or aspired to ""live in concrete cleanliness."" ""We forget that to construct (houses) in this kind of modernist way -- that has become a global international style since the 1930s -- we are destroying our planet,"" she argues.
""You're basically trying to mold the place to the material -- and the result has been more detrimental than positive,"" Smith adds.
The concrete and cement industry has grown tenfold over the past 65 years, steel production threefold, while low-carbon timber production per capita has experienced nearly stagnant growth, per a recent UN Environment Programme report.
The same report calculated that in 2021, the manufacturing of key building materials concrete, steel and aluminum ""added a further 4% of global energy use and 6% of global emissions.""  ""Houses That Can Save the World"" contains plenty of examples of the good that can come from molding materials to the place.
In Mpigi, Uganda, Upcycle Africa co-founder Johnmary Kavuma lost his grandmother when her house collapsed due to flooding caused by plastic waste clogging drainage ditches, says Topham. The social enterprise now collects plastic bottles and uses them as a building material in its roundhouses, alleviating a pollution problem while providing new homes.
Despite their positive outlook, the authors acknowledge that implementing the ideas in their book can be challenging.
""As soon as you move away from (typical construction methods) it either becomes difficult to find the people to do it, it becomes incredibly expensive or it's really time-consuming,"" says Topham. ""I think for your average homeowner, to do anything remotely like the examples in the book is so difficult. A lot of those barriers need to come down.""
Nevertheless, the writers are keen to practice what they preach. Smith plans to overhaul the heating at her period Texan home and fit a solar array on the roof.
The trend towards a more conscious way of building ""is truly a global movement, and that in itself gives me hope,"" says Smith.

0;Mississippi State head football coach Mike Leach has died at 61 from heart condition complications;"Mississippi State head football coach Mike Leach died Monday night from heart condition complications, the university announced on Tuesday. He was 61.

“Mike was a giving and attentive husband, father and grandfather,” the Leach family said in a statement via the school.

“He was able to participate in organ donation at UMMC as a final act of charity. We are supported and uplifted by the outpouring of love and prayers from family, friends, Mississippi State University, the hospital staff, and football fans around the world. Thank you for sharing in the joy of our beloved husband and father’s life.”

Southeastern Conference (SEC) Commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement: “The life of Mike Leach touched thousands upon thousands of people through his coaching, leadership teaching and insightful commentary. “We will miss Mike. Every conversation with Mike made you think. His humor, depth and point of view continually challenged all of us to think differently and reevaluate our perspectives … We mourn his untimely passing as we offer our support to Mike’s wife, Sharon, their children and grandchildren, along with his current and former players, coaching colleagues and the Mississippi State community.”

The two-time national coach of the year was in his third year at Mississippi State. He led the Bulldogs to an 8-4 record this season.

Leach compiled a 158-107 overall record in 21 seasons – 10 at Texas Tech, eight at Washington State and three at Mississippi State.

Texas Tech said in a statement, “Texas Tech Athletics joins the countless others across the game of football who mourn the passing of Mike Leach.”

“Coach Leach will be forever remembered as one of the most innovative offensive minds in college football history. His impact on Texas Tech Football alone will live on in history as one of the greatest tenures in the history of our program.”

Similarly, Washington State remembered the man who “changed the game of football.”

WSU Director of Athletics Pat Chun said, “We were fortunate to have Coach Leach lead the WSU Football program for 8 years. Mike will be forever loved, terribly missed and never forgotten.” ";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/sport/mike-leach-death-mississippi-state-spt-intl
0;Kenyan double Olympic gold medalist David Rudisha survives plane crash;"Kenyan runner David Rudisha, a two-time Olympic 800m gold medalist, survived a plane crash in Kenya on Saturday, according to a statement from the non-profit conservation organization Big Life Foundation.

Rudisha and five others were leaving an event known as the Masai Olympics in Kimana, Kenya when the small airplane they were on was forced to make an emergency landing shortly after take-off, according to Big Life, which was one of the organizers of the event.

Big Life confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that Rudisha and the other passengers were fine, with the former gold medal winner having “suffered no significant physical injuries.” “It happened very fast,” two-time 800m world champion Rudisha told CNN. “We’re lucky we survived. There were just a few injuries, but most of us came out without any major injuries.”

CNN has reached out to the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority which is investigating the crash.

Rudisha won the 800m Olympic title at London 2012 in sensational fashion, beating his nearest competitor by almost a second and setting the current world record of 1:40.91 – the only time in history someone has run the distance below 1:41. He defended his crown four years later in Rio to become only the fourth man in history to win two 800m Olympic golds.

0;Two sisters just reunited with the mystery woman who gave them $100 on a plane 23 years ago;"New York (CNN) — Ayda Zugay clasps her hands together, trying to keep her nerves in check.
She's been waiting for this day for decades.
At any moment the woman she tried to find for so long will finally be here.
It's been more than 23 years since a stranger on an airplane gave Zugay and her sister an envelope with $100 in it that would change their lives.
A CNN story last spring featured Zugay's quest to find the woman and thank her. At the time, Zugay only knew that the woman's first name was Tracy, that she played tennis and that her act of generosity had made a tremendous difference in the lives of two refugees from the former Yugoslavia who were just beginning a new life in the United States.
The story reached millions of readers -- many of whom sent in tips to help with the search. Several of them saw the handwriting on the envelope and knew right away who was behind it: Tracy Peck of Blaine, Minnesota.
Zugay and her older sister, Vanja Contino, reconnected with Peck in an emotional Zoom call that weekend.
But they haven't had a chance to meet in person -- until now, when an invitation to appear as special guests on ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" has brought all three women to New York City.
 It's a joyful occasion. But as they wait for Peck to arrive, Zugay tells her sister that she's feeling anxious and emotional.
What if the moment doesn't feel right? What if they struggle to connect with each other? What if the woman who's inspired her for so many years ends up seeing her as a disappointment?
Tears well up in her eyes.
""I don't want to let her down,"" she says.
Contino tells her sister that could never happen.
""You are an amazing person,"" she says. ""This is all happening because of you.""
The three women share a tearful embrace
Zugay and Contino hide themselves behind a Christmas tree covered with gleaming gold ornaments, hoping to surprise Peck when she arrives.
As they wait, the Midtown Manhattan hotel lobby where they've planned to meet is bustling. Guests toting suitcases and shopping bags dart past them, oblivious to the dramatic moment that's about to unfold.
Even though they know she's coming, Peck catches them by surprise when she finally appears.
""Hi!"" the sisters shout in unison, rushing forward to wrap their arms around Peck.
""My lovelies!"" Peck exclaims. Her face reddens as tears stream down her cheeks. ""Oh! This is such a blessing,"" she says, and they hold each other tighter.
To Peck, the hug feels like an embrace from family members she's known for years.
To Contino, it's an amazing connection between the past and the present that she never imagined would be possible.
To Zugay, it feels like a moment of closure, and a moment of something new that's just beginning.
They have a lot to catch up on
A few minutes later, Zugay and Peck settle down on the couch in Zugay's hotel room. Contino sits on a chair nearby, snapping photos and taking in the scene.
They've exchanged some texts and messages on social media since their virtual meetup in the spring. When she got engaged several months ago, Zugay texted Peck to tell her.
But there's so much more to catch up on, and so much to share.
The last time these three women sat side by side, they were in very different places, even though they were flying to the same destination.
On May 31, 1999, Peck was in her late 40s and had just finished a dream vacation watching the French Open with friends. Contino, then 17, and Zugay, then nearly 12, had just said goodbye to their parents and everything they knew as they fled their war-torn country.
Peck was heading home to be with her family. Zugay and Contino were heading into uncertainty. They were seeking refuge in the United States, but had no idea what they'd find once they arrived.
Zugay didn't speak much English then, but she sensed the compassion in her seatmate's voice.
""We were able to communicate even though we had so many differences,"" she says.
After hearing the sisters' story that day, Peck handed them an envelope at the end of the flight, telling them to wait until they got off the plane to open it. Inside she tucked a $100 bill and the dangly earrings she'd been wearing.
""To the girls from Yugoslavia --"" her note on the outside of the envelope began. ""I am so sorry that the bombing of your country has caused your family any problems. I hope your stay in America will be a safe and happy one for you — Welcome to America — please use this to help you here. A friend from the plane — TRACY"". Peck had no idea how much that gesture would come to mean to its recipients -- and how much writing it would end up changing her life, too.
Contino, who's now 41 and an anesthesiologist in Connecticut, sees the envelope as a reason why she still tries to prioritize giving to people in need, and why she's teaching her two daughters to do that, too.
Zugay, a 35-year-old who lives in Boston, sees Peck's simple act of generosity as the foundation of many things in her life, including her work with numerous nonprofits and the consulting company she cofounded.
And now that they're finally reunited, Zugay wants to make sure Peck knows how much it's meant.
""I thought of you for so many years,"" she says. ""It was almost like you were next to me in the things I was doing.""
For the sisters, Tracy's handwritten note was a piece of a puzzle
Zugay unzips a black backpack, pulls out the envelope and hands it to Peck.
It's in remarkably good condition, with no major wrinkles or tears. Zugay keeps it with her important documents and has tried hard to protect it.
""This is so wonderful,"" Peck says. ""I just can't believe you kept this all these years.""
Peck says she's amazed Zugay kept searching when so many others would have given up.
""Thank you so much for everything, Tracy,"" Zugay says. ""You're such a beautiful person. I'm so excited for your joy to radiate across the planet."" Zugay tells Peck she still remembers having a panic attack once when she thought she'd lost the envelope, and the many hours she spent looking at it and searching for clues. For so many years, that piece of paper seemed to be the only thing connecting her to a puzzle in her past she needed to solve.
Now that she and Peck have reunited, the envelope itself doesn't seem as important. But what it symbolizes seems more important than ever. And that, Zugay says, is why she's determined to keep telling the story.
""It's been really beautiful to be able to elevate the message of welcoming people, and encouraging people to be kind,"" she says. ""You don't have to be a wealthy philanthropist; you don't have to be somebody who has a lot of power. You can be an average person, and you can have an incredible impact on somebody's life.""
Tracy's act of kindness has touched many others
Since CNN's coverage of her search began, Zugay estimates she's received more than 2,300 emails from readers who were moved by Tracy's story.
Some shared their own experiences of reaching out to others or receiving unexpected support at moments when they felt lost.
One person wrote that they'd been dangerously close to suicide but reconsidered after reading about Zugay's search for Tracy.
""Something woke up in me that was quiet for so long. ... Instead of ending my life that day, I walked around the city feeling gratitude for people like Tracy in my life,"" the note said. ""Now when I think about what I hope to build out of my life, I will always think of you and Tracy."" Zugay says it's been overwhelming and inspiring to receive so many beautiful messages.
But while most responses have been positive, a few negative emails have also made their way to her inbox.
To Zugay, that's important to acknowledge, too.
""That's why I do the work I do,"" she says. ""The goal is for everybody here to feel belonging and welcome and to thrive.""
And no matter how many negative responses she gets, Zugay says finding Tracy makes it all worthwhile.
The three women go sightseeing in New York
When Peck learned she'd be traveling to New York, there was one thing she knew she wanted to see with Zugay and Contino: the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.
""To me, the whole idea of Christmas is about love and giving and kindness,"" Peck says. And who better to see the tree with than the women who'd given her such a beautiful reminder of how a small act of kindness can grow into something so much bigger?
So after hours of swapping stories about their family members, discussing their lives and careers, and sharing memories of the past and dreams for the future, the trio venture out to the packed sidewalks of Midtown Manhattan for a glimpse of the iconic sight. At points, it feels like someone is shoving them from every direction. In the commotion, Zugay and Contino try to keep their eyes trained on Peck's blonde hair.
""We can't lose Tracy now,"" Contino laughs, ""not after we finally found her.""
They marvel at the Saks Fifth Avenue holiday lights display and snap selfies beside the tree.
""So beautiful,"" Peck says.
And no matter how crowded the sidewalks around them get, the three women stick together.
Reuniting in person, Peck says, has brought even more unexpected joy than their initial conversation.
""Love and friendship among women is to me among the greatest gifts in the world,"" she says. ""I feel I've gained that bond with these two amazing women.""
They get a standing ovation at 'CNN Heroes'
Waiting backstage the next day as they prepare for their appearance on ""CNN Heroes,"" the women marvel at the stories of this year's honorees.
""There are good people in this world,"" Contino says.
Zugay nods in agreement.
Before long, a familiar voice echoes in the event space as a video plays that includes excerpts from their May reunion on Zoom.
It's Tracy -- the Tracy. Hearing her voice makes Zugay feel instantly emotional. Now they're together at last.
The audience gives them a standing ovation as they walk on stage side by side. Their New York reunion is more than they ever expected
As they return to their New York hotel after the show, they rehash highlights of the night -- the celebrities who stopped them in the hallway to marvel at their story, the many honorees doing extraordinary things for their communities and, best of all, the fact that they got to spend an entire weekend together after so many years apart.
Peck thinks back to the young girls she met on the plane and how brave they were that day.
""I wouldn't have been nearly as strong as you were. I wouldn't have been mature enough to do it. ... I'm so proud of you, the two women you've become,"" she says.
Zugay thinks back to her many years searching for Tracy, and what she hoped she'd find.
""You turned out to be so much more than I ever expected,"" Zugay tells Peck. ""Just hearing your voice means so much to me. I can't wait to hear about our future days together.""
They're hoping to plan a bigger reunion so more members of their families can meet. And next year, Zugay hopes Peck will be a guest at her wedding.
Still reveling in the many inspiring stories of the evening and the chance they had to share the moment together, Zugay says she feels so overwhelmed with gratitude that she won't be able to sleep.
Over the years, the efforts of so many people helped her find Tracy -- at least 17, by her latest count, from the first journalist to cover her story for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune to the videographer who helped her get the word out on social media.
Tonight, she can only think of one thing to do: write her own notes, just like Tracy did, thanking them.";https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/refugee-sisters-tracy-airplane-reunion-cnnheroes-cec
0;Nelly Cheboi, who creates computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is CNN’s Hero of the Year;"Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year. Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes.

Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future.

Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.

As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.

“The world is your oyster when you are educated”
Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.”

A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.

“When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN.

Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.

“I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said.

Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. “We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said.

So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. “At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said.

A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.

The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.

“We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.”

The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.

“My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.” An inspiring night of heroism and advocacy
CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters.

“We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.”

Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added. Debra Vines – whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago – was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a “fellow autism mom.”

Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. “Join me and be a servant for the change today,” Vines said when accepting her award.

And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker ??and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue.

Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders:

Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started “Three Wishes for Ruby’s Residents,” which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn’t otherwise afford them.

Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started “Recycle My Battery,” which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins.

The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.

0;71 years after starting college, a 90-year-old woman is graduating;"A 90-year-old woman will finally walk across the stage and receive her diploma, 71 years after she first enrolled in college.

Joyce DeFauw, then Joyce Viola Kane, started her freshman year at Northern Illinois University in 1951 with a plan to graduate with a degree in home economics.

But those plans changed when DeFauw met a special man at church who stole her heart, she told CNN Thursday.

“I went to school for three and a half years, but decided to leave after I met him.” DeFauw said. The special man was Don Freeman Sr. The two got married in 1955, and had three children together before Freeman passed away, leaving her widowed for about five years.

DeFauw eventually got remarried to her late second husband, Roy DeFauw. Together they had six children, including two sets of twins.

Throughout the years her family grew, and she now has 17 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.

Flash forward to 2019 when DeFauw showed interest in the college education she left behind.

“I guess I mentioned I was upset that I didn’t finish school and my children encouraged me to go back,” she said, so she enrolled back at Northern Illinois and began taking classes.

Jenna Dooley, one of DeFauw’s 17 grandchildren and an alumnus of NIU, told CNN it was more about the ‘why not’ versus the ‘why’, when DeFauw decided to go back.

Dooley said when she was growing up she’d visit her grandmother in her farmhouse where DeFauw would always be baking or cooking.

DeFauw used to be a Sunday school teacher as well. “She’s always had that love of teaching and learning,” Dooley said. “When we made calls to the school about a previous enrollment, they were shocked to hear we were asking about a student from the 50s,” Dooley said.

But this time around, things were much different for DeFauw.

Instead of walking to campus to attend class, she did so behind a computer screen from her retirement home.

“It was my first computer,” DeFauw said, “My children had to teach me how to use it.” Dooley added her uncle Don, DeFauw’s oldest son, helped set up the computer, get a camera for the computer and taught her how to navigate her school email.

When the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, she was thankful for the computer, Dooley said. “It worked out really well that she was already set up online,” She added.

She was on her own during that time and could have no visitors, Dooley said. “At times she’d get frustrated, but I kept reminding her that this was all a part of the process.” She added.

“At times I wanted to quit, but I didn’t.” DeFauw said. She said she had plenty of encouragement from family, friends and the school.

Director of Bachelor General Studies, Judy Santacaterina, was a huge help for DeFauw. Dooley said she took on the role of helping her grandmother get her degree and the entire family is grateful for Santacaterina.

DeFauw took one class each semester, including during the summer. “She’s very organized,” Dooley said, “She has a routine. She wanted to keep taking classes so she wouldn’t fall out of that routine.”

Now, three years later, she’ll put on the cap and gown and receive a Bachelor of General Studies degree from the university this weekend.

DeFauw is thankful she had the opportunity to get to go back to school and get her degree. “It’s nice to finish something you started,” she said.

Her piece of advice to those who may be in a similar situation: “Don’t give up,” she said, “I know it can be difficult, but everything in life has its ups and downs.”

“She has a gift of learning and teaching, so to be able to celebrate this with joy is the icing on the cake.” Dooley said.";https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/11/us/90-year-old-woman-graduates-college-trnd
1;Biden Is Bringing Africa’s Leaders to Washington, Hoping to Impress;"NAIROBI, Kenya — In Russia, Africa’s leaders were feted at a seaside resort where military aircraft for sale were parked outside the summit hall. In China, they dined with President Xi Jinping, some of them one-on-one, and received promises of investments worth $60 billion. In Turkey, they won support for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council.

Now they are headed to Washington for a major summit hosted by President Biden — the latest diplomatic drive by a major foreign power seeking to strengthen its ties to Africa, a continent whose geopolitical clout has grown greatly in the past decade.

An international scramble for military, commercial and diplomatic interests in Africa, long dominated by China, has expanded in recent years to include other powers like Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. In this intense competition, the U.S. has often lagged behind, analysts say — a decline the Biden administration hopes to reverse with the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that starts on Tuesday.

White House officials say the three-day gathering will include top-level meetings, new initiatives and business deals, and a gala dinner at the White House. But African leaders have grown accustomed to being courted by foreign suitors, and Washington is one stop on what has become a global circuit of Africa summits held by China, Russia, Turkey, France, Japan and the European Union.

As the planes of over 40 African heads of state descend on Washington, a question looms: What can Mr. Biden offer that they want?

“The U.S. has traditionally seen Africa as a problem to be solved,” said Murithi Mutiga, Africa director at the International Crisis Group. “But its competitors see Africa as a place of opportunity, which is why they are pulling ahead. It’s unclear if this conference is going to change that.” Africa’s top diplomat says that, first of all, they want to be heard.

“When we talk, we’re often not listened to, or in any case, not with enough interest,” President Macky Sall of Senegal, who is president of the African Union, said in an interview in Dakar last Thursday. “This is what we want to change. And let no one tell us no, don’t work with so-and-so, just work with us. We want to work and trade with everyone.”

Much has changed since the first U.S.-Africa summit, hosted by President Barack Obama in 2014. Chinese trade with Africa has continued to grow — hitting a record high last year of $261 billion — as have the debts of African countries to China. In contrast, U.S. trade with Africa has dwindled to $64 billion — a mere 1.1 percent of U.S. global commerce.

Russia has emerged as the continent’s largest arms dealer and become a muscular force across a swath of the continent through its use of mercenaries from the Wagner Group to prop up shaky regimes, often in return for precious minerals. Turkey has built dozens of new embassies and Turkish companies have been on a spree, constructing airports, mosques, hospitals and sports stadiums, even in unlikely conflict zones like Somalia. The U.A.E. has built ports on the Red Sea and supplied armed drones to Ethiopia. The issues that have long hobbled Africa’s progress remain, including poverty, conflict, threatened famines and corruption. But the continent also has many new strengths that are drawing foreign powers.

As birthrates tumble elsewhere, Africa’s population is projected to double by 2050, when the continent will account for one-quarter of the world’s people — potentially a huge market. Africa’s huge reserves of rare minerals will be needed to power the electric vehicles of the future.

Africa’s vast forests are among the world’s biggest carbon sinks, and its cultural footprint is expanding. Nigerian Afrobeats music is wildly popular worldwide, its movie industry is growing, and a thriving tech sector in countries like Kenya has emerged as a source of innovation and cheap software talent.

That new strength has changed the tone of Africa’s relationship with wealthy Western nations. On a visit in 2009, President Obama brought a message of tough love, saying that American help to Africa should be matched by Africans taking responsibility for their problems.

These days American officials stress partnership, and shared interests and values. Africa has become “a major geopolitical force,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in August. “One that shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will shape our future.” What’s less clear is whether this week’s summit will match up to that soaring rhetoric.

In a series of briefings, U.S. officials said the summit would feature a string of business deals between African and American companies, and an initiative to boost the continent’s “digital economy.” President Biden will announce American support for an African Union seat on the G20, as well as for greater African representation in global institutions like the International Monetary Fund.

There will be initiatives to tap the African diaspora for new ideas in higher education, creative industries and the environment and for collaborations with NASA on space programs. A guide for summit delegates, obtained by The New York Times, predicts that Africa’s “space economy” will grow 30 percent by 2024 — an opportunity for the U.S. to help with technologies to solve problems related to climate change, agriculture, security and illegal fishing and mining.

But there is little sign that Mr. Biden intends to launch a signature policy initiative like previous American administrations.

A massive project to combat H.I.V. and AIDS, launched by President George W. Bush in 2003 and known as PEPFAR, has cost $100 billion and saved 25 million lives, according to the government. President Obama’s biggest initiative was Power Africa, which has brought electricity to 60 million African homes — about half its original goal.

In this summit, Mr. Biden’s approach is broader, driven by a theme of “building 21st century partnerships,” Judd Devermont, Africa director at the National Security Council, said last week. The coming decade will reshape the world order, Mr. Devermont added, and “African voices are going to be critical in this conversation.” But at summits elsewhere, African leaders often leave with hard promises of assistance — Chinese infrastructure, Russian weapons or Turkish drones, for instance. Analysts say that American talk of respect and shared values may not be enough for them.

“African countries don’t want to be taken out for an ice cream,” said Michelle D. Gavin, a senior fellow for Africa Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “They want debt relief. They want loss and damage. They want a TRIPS waiver.”

(TRIPS is an intellectual property law that African countries want waived so they can manufacture vaccines.)

The White House says it will use the summit to revitalize older American initiatives like the Africa Growth Opportunity Act, a Clinton-era law lowering some trade barriers to Africa, which is set to expire in 2025. While that approach makes sense, the danger is that African leaders will “see it as a downgrade,” said Cameron Hudson, an Africa specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“When you prioritize everything, you prioritize nothing,” he added.

America retains considerable clout across much of Africa. Its diplomats played an invaluable back room role in helping to broker a recent peace deal in Ethiopia. It is the key foreign player in Somalia in the fight against Al Shabab militants. It sends many billions of dollars in aid to the continent’s poorest corners — far more than China, which gives little, or Russia, which gives almost nothing. Still, the growing range of international powers crowding into the continent means that African leaders know they have choices — turning to one ally for aid, and another for weapons, for instance — and don’t like to be forced to take sides.

In the war against Ukraine, several countries including the continent’s economic powerhouse, South Africa, have been reluctant to take sides against Russia. American officials have been careful not to frame this week’s summit as part of America’s wider competition with China.

Some Biden officials are so keen to avoid mention of China that they jokingly call it the “Voldemort” of U.S. foreign policy — a reference to a “Harry Potter” villain whose name is rarely uttered.

But the rivalry is obvious to many on the ground in Africa.

At Makerere University in Uganda, a student, Abiji Mary Immaculate, credited the U.S. with doing “a lot of good” for her country. The U.S. gives nearly $1 billion a year for health and development, the State Department says.

But ordinary Ugandans often struggle to understand those benefits, she added, while they can see Chinese-built roads and bridges “every day of their lives.”

Sithembile Mbete, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Pretoria, welcomed this week’s summit as a chance for the U.S. to deal with African countries as a bloc, and move away from a tendency to cherry-pick favored allies.

But whether it succeeds, she added, depends on if Mr. Biden is willing to truly engage with Africans as equals, and not “as a big brother telling countries what to do.” ";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/africa/us-africa-summit.html
1;Russia Is Using Old Ukrainian Missiles Against Ukraine, General Says;"KYIV, Ukraine — Shortly after a large wave of Russian missiles slammed into targets across the country in October, Ukraine’s intelligence officials noticed something strange in the rubble.

It was the wreckage of a Kh-55 subsonic cruise missile designed in the 1970s to carry a nuclear warhead. The warhead had been removed and ballast added to disguise the fact that it was not carrying a payload, said Gen. Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy intelligence chief — an assertion now backed by the Pentagon and British military intelligence.

But that was not all the intelligence officials found. The missile had been built in a Ukrainian weapons factory.

The missile, and the bomber that most likely delivered it, was part of a cache of weaponry handed over to Russia by Ukraine in the 1990s as part of an international agreement aimed at assuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, General Skibitsky said.

In November, Ukrainian forces found the remnants of two more Kh-55 missiles, also with their warheads removed, and part of the same tranche of weapons that Ukraine had sent to Russia under the agreement.

Russia was using Ukraine’s own armaments as decoys against it. They served a strategic goal: Sending up the missiles would force Ukraine to mobilize its air-defense system against them. “First, the Kh-55 missile is launched; we react to it,” General Skibitsky said, speaking in a lengthy interview at military intelligence headquarters in Kyiv last week, before the latest missile strikes across the country. “It’s like a false target.”

After the Ukrainian air defenses are engaged, he said, Russian bombers launch the more modern missiles, with destructive warheads.

The three missiles are part of a larger number of retrofitted older missiles used in strikes, some as decoys and some modernized with warheads.

The use of old cruise missiles — including ones built in Ukraine decades ago — is just one element in a complex and deadly conflict in which deception plays a role, along with fighting on the battleground.

As part of the 1990s agreement, known as the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear arsenal — the world’s third-largest at the time, inherited from the collapsed Soviet Union — and transfer all nuclear warheads to Russia for decommissioning in return for security assurances.

“All ballistic missiles, Tu-160 and Tu-95 strategic bombers were also handed over,” said General Skibitsky. “Now, they are using Kh-55 missiles against us with these bombers. It would be better if we handed them over to the U.S.A.”

The general also offered a detailed assessment of current Russian capabilities and Ukraine’s ability to counter the threat.

His account corresponds generally with public statements from other Ukrainian military officials, the British Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon and military analysts.

“According to our calculations, they have missiles for another three to five waves of attacks,” he said. “This is if there are 80 to 90 rockets in one wave.”

Last Monday, Russia fired more than 70 missiles at Ukraine after Ukraine struck two military installations deep inside Russia.

While Russia’s stockpiles of its most modern, precision missiles are widely believed to be running low, General Skibitsky said that Russian arms factories had been able to build 240 precision Kh-101 cruise missiles and about 120 of the sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles since the start of the war, which works out to about 40 new missiles per month. Those numbers could not be independently confirmed. Despite Western sanctions, Russia has continued to produce new precision missiles, as recently as October, according to a report released last week by Conflict Armament Research, an independent group based in Britain that identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition used in wars.

Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force, said that after the latest assault, investigators found many fragments that indicated the precision cruise missiles used in the attack had been made in recent weeks.

“Russia is using newly manufactured missiles,” he told Ukrainian radio on Thursday.

As the Russians seek to bolster their arsenal, Ukrainian officials say they are getting better at shooting down many types of missiles and drones fired their way.

Over the course of November, Brig. Gen. Oleksiy Hromov, a deputy chief on the Ukrainian General Staff, said that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 percent of the 239 Russian cruise missiles and 80 percent of the 80 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones. They claim to have shot down 60 of the 70 missiles on Monday, or 85 percent.

But the missiles and drones that get through can still do widespread damage, depending on what they hit. On Saturday, Ukraine shot down 10 of 15 attack drones, but several hit critical infrastructure in Odesa, leaving 1.5 million people without power.

Leaning over the table and drawing a map of Ukraine, General Skibitsky outlined the four general directions from which Moscow is trying to penetrate Ukraine’s skies — sending missiles flying into Ukraine from the Black Sea in the south, from the area around the Caspian Sea to the southeast, from Russia in the east and from Belarus to the north.

During large-scale attacks, which have featured up to about 100 missiles launched within minutes of one another, they fly in from all directions at the same time.

Since October, the general said, the flight patterns of the Russian bombers have been changing, taking circuitous routes to avoid air defenses. But they do not enter Ukrainian air space, limiting their effectiveness.

Typically, Ukrainian intelligence has about an hour after Russian bombers take off from a base to track the flights before pilots reach the “fire zone” and launch missiles.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles.html 
1;Snow and Cold Bring Parts of U.K. to a Standstill;"LONDON — A coating of snow and ice on Sunday upended travel in Britain and put increased pressure on the country’s energy supplies, already under strain from a prolonged cold snap.

The winter weather intensified Sunday as a foggy afternoon turned into a snowy evening across much of the country, with a few inches of snow continuing to fall in parts of the country into early Monday. Temperatures in parts of Britain, especially in London and other areas in the south, are not often cold enough for snow, making each infrequent occurrence a delight for the eyes but a headache for transit.

But the past week has seen plenty of snow-ready frigid temperatures, with more expected in the week ahead.

As snow dusted the country on Sunday, flights were canceled from London to Glasgow, with some London airports, including Gatwick and Stansted, briefly closing their runways on Sunday night to clear snow. The delays continued into Monday as airlines worked through backlogs of canceled flights amid freezing weather. Some rail lines also reported weather-related delays.

The Met Office warned that fallen snow and icy patches would continue to create hazardous conditions for drivers and cyclists in parts of southern England, including London, into Tuesday. Farther north, in parts of Scotland and northern England, travel disruptions are likely to continue until Thursday.

In Solihull, outside Birmingham, on Sunday, three boys, aged 8, 10 and 11, died after falling into an icy lake, the West Midlands Police said on Monday. A fourth boy, 6, remained in critical condition in a hospital, the police said.

An investigation is continuing to determine what happened and if anyone else fell into the water. Superintendent Richard Harris of the West Midlands Police said on Monday afternoon that they had no indication anyone else was in the water, “but until we are 100 percent certain, we will be carrying on searches throughout the course of today.” Britain had already endured a week of frigid temperatures, with more below-freezing lows expected. A Level 3 cold weather alert is in place for much of England until Friday. The authorities have advised people to check in on vulnerable friends and family to ensure they have access to warm food and drinks and are able to heat their homes. Oliver Claydon, a spokesman for the Met Office, said seven centimeters, or 2.7 inches, of snow had been recorded in Essex, a county northeast of London, and four centimeters, or about an inch and a half, had been recorded in East Sussex in southeast England.

Sleet and snow would gradually ease in southeast England, Mr. Claydon said. “Tomorrow, the cold will continue, with frost and fog lingering in places,” he said, adding that the snow was expected to be most persistent across northern Scotland.

The extended cold streak has put extra stress on energy supplies. The National Grid, which operates Britain’s electricity system, warmed up two contingency coal plants to “give the public confidence in Monday’s energy supply,” it said in a statement. It canceled the start-up notices later on Monday.

About 40 people who had to abandon their cars because of the snow spent the night at a pub in the English village of Burwash, about 50 miles southeast of London. Pauline Wilson, the landlady of the Bear Inn, a pub and hotel, said she laid out mattresses and blankets on the floor.

About 15 people checked into the hotel rooms, including three women who had just met who shared a room. The other stranded people slept on chairs, the floor and in front of the fireplace. Two couples who had just met shared a duvet cover, she said.

In the morning, Ms. Wilson made tea and coffee for the guests and people had cookies.

“I’ve lived in this village all my life, and I’ve never seen anything like this in December,” she said.

Karl and Liz Tazzyman, who live in Sheffield, England, more than 150 miles north of London, marveled at the snow in Central London early Monday.

“Yesterday we were on Oxford Street when it started snowing and it was really exciting,” Ms. Tazzyman, 38, said. “It was just lovely and Christmassy and everybody was excited about it.” Mr. Tazzyman, 42, was equally aware that the cold snap blanketing much of Britain this week could cause financial problems for many.

“There’s a lot of families who will have a very, very hard Christmas,” he said. “It’s heat or eat. For some people it’s one or the other, they can’t pick both.”

The cost of energy has soared in Britain, as Russia has restricted the flow of natural gas to Europe, pushing up prices everywhere, including in places like Britain that don’t use much Russian gas. The British government has implemented price caps, which it says is saving a typical household around 900 pounds ($1,106) this winter, but energy prices are still much higher than they have been in past winters. Ruth London, the co-director and founder for Fuel Poverty Action, a charity that aims to protect people from energy poverty, said people were struggling with higher energy costs, particularly since many homes in Britain are poorly insulated.

“Lots of people are forgoing heat altogether — in this weather, it’s something we wouldn’t even have imagined a couple of years ago,” Ms. London said. “People are sleeping with tons of blankets and their coats and hats and gloves on, and people can’t use heat even when they’re ill.”

John Stean, a plumbing and heating engineer who lives outside of London, said he saw some 200 abandoned cars on the highway Sunday night as he drove back to Essex from Suffolk. The drive, which usually takes two hours, took about five hours because of the snow, he said.

“It’s nice to look at from your window, but to drive about in, this county is not made for it. People just don’t have the experience,” said Mr. Stean, who canceled one of his outside installation jobs on Monday because of the ice and snow.

To others, it was a joyous occasion. In north London, Finsbury Park was bustling with people throwing snowballs, making snow angels and sledding, including Margaux Colnard from France.

Ms. Colnard, 30, said she was excited because there had not been a significant snow in London in several years and she wanted to take advantage of it.

“I don’t have work because my boss is off work because of the snow,” she said. “I’m here with all my flatmates.”

Ms. Colnard said when she was done with sledding, she would turn her attention to drinking hot chocolate with Baileys and watching Christmas movies.

Rachel Conlon and Sam Fawcett, both 29, work from home and decided to extend their lunch breaks on Monday by having a snowball fight in the center of Finsbury Park. They’re also aware of the rising costs of heat and will perhaps find someplace else to spend the evening.

“We’ll try and keep warm,” Mr. Fawcett said. “Maybe go for a pint?”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/uk-cold-london-snow.html
1;Ukraine says it struck a hotel where members of Russia’s Wagner security force had gathered.;"A Ukrainian rocket attack on a hotel in the east of the country killed members of the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary force whose leader has close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin, regional Ukrainian military authorities have said.

The exiled head of the Ukrainian regional administration in Luhansk Province, Serhiy Haidai, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that “many” members of the Wagner force had been killed in the attack on Sunday in the city of Kadiivka. He posted a grainy photograph, taken at night, of a courtyard surrounded on three sides by a two-story building, which appeared to have been shattered by an explosion. There was a crater in the center of the courtyard.

Mr. Haidai’s claim could not be independently verified, and there was no immediate comment or confirmation from the Wagner Group. Telegram channels linked to the Wagner Group were quiet, with no real mention of the strike.

The Russian state news agency Tass reported in a Telegram post that a HIMARS rocket had destroyed a hotel close to the central market but did not mention the Wagner Group. Using the old Soviet name for the city, Stakhanov, in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, the report cited the office of the mayor and said that rescuers were clearing the rubble. , It did not give details of casualties or say who was staying in the hotel.

There was no independent confirmation that Wagner forces were in the hotel, but such a strike would fit a pattern of attacks by Ukrainian forces on critical points of military infrastructure or concentrations of troops in territory occupied by Russian forces. Over the weekend, Ukraine struck a church in the occupied city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine that Russian troops were using as a base.

In recent months, Ukraine has made use of longer-range weapons, such as HIMARS, a system supplied by the United States, that are capable of pinpointing targets behind Russian lines. Those strikes were part of a campaign by Ukraine that began in August and culminated in the recapture of the city of Kherson on the west bank of the Dnipro River. The recent attacks suggest Ukraine might be following a similar approach in hopes of advancing on Russian positions east of the river.

Ukrainian forces would “continue to pound” Russian local headquarters and logistics points for the next few weeks “in order to set the conditions for the decisive phase of the campaign,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges said on CNN on Monday.

The Wagner Group, led by the businessman Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, has played a central role in Russia’s attempt to storm the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk Province, which borders Luhansk. The fighting, waged over months amid heavy losses on both sides, has been some of the most brutal since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.

Taking to the Woods With Maine’s ‘Tree Tippers’
Military experts say that the capture of Bakhmut would be of limited strategic value to Moscow but it would serve a political purpose given that Russia last captured a significant Ukrainian city in the summer and, since September, has sustained a series of battlefield losses in the northeast and south of the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says Kyiv’s aim is to reclaim all of the territory seized by Russia since 2014. Its campaign in the south and east has been slowed in recent weeks by the onset of winter, though that has not altered the tempo of longer-range attacks.

The pace of ground attacks could quicken when the ground freezes, said Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov.

“We have seen rains and very difficult conditions for attacks from any side because the ground is wet and wheeled vehicles can hardly pass,” he told journalists in the city of Odesa on Sunday. He added that “when the ground will become firmer, I am convinced that we will continue our counterattacks.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/wagner-group-ukraine-strike.html
1;E.U. Roiled by Corruption Inquiry Linked to Qatar;"BRUSSELS — As the Belgian authorities broadened their investigation into allegations that European Parliament lawmakers and others may have taken bribes from Qatar, the assembly’s president warned on Monday that illegal lobbying posed a major threat to the institution.

“European democracy is under attack,” the president, Roberta Metsola, said in an emotional speech to fellow lawmakers.

Days after raiding residences and official offices and seizing evidence that included hundreds of thousands of euros in cash, the Belgian police on Monday launched new searches at European Parliament offices.

The searches were taking place as Ms. Metsola addressed European lawmakers in the French city of Strasbourg, the second headquarters of the Parliament.

Officials in Qatar have denied any wrongdoing.

Ms. Metsola said that the European Parliament was launching its own, internal inquiry and that it would continue assisting the authorities with their investigation.

The purpose of the new searches in Brussels, the federal prosecutor’s office said in a statement, was to seize information harvested from the devices of 10 members of the Parliament’s staff. On Sunday, there were also several raids conducted by the police in Italy. “A total of 20 searches have been carried out since the beginning of the operations, including 19 in private homes and the one in the offices of the European Parliament,” the prosecutor said in the statement.

The Belgian authorities said they had secured computers from 10 parliamentary staffers. Since Friday, the prosecutor’s office said, they have recovered one bag with 600,000 euros ($632,000) in cash in the possession of one suspect, 150,000 euros in cash in the home of a European Parliament staffer and “several hundred thousand euros in a suitcase in a Brussels hotel room.”  Since the raids were launched on Friday, after four months of investigation, six people have been taken in for questioning. Four have been charged with corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organization, among them a high-profile European lawmaker from Greece, Eva Kaili. Two more people were arrested in Italy in connection with the same case, the Belgian prosecutor’s office said.

A former member of Parliament, Pier Antonio Panzeri, was also charged, as was Ms. Kaili’s life partner, Francesco Giorgi, a close associate of Mr. Panzeri’s who works as an aide to a sitting member of Parliament.

The defendants face up to 15 years in prison for the crimes they are accused of, Belgian legal experts said.

The Belgian prosecutor did not identify lawyers for the defendants, and their offices and family members did not respond to multiple requests since Friday for comment.

Ms. Kaili’s assets, as well as those of her father and sister, in her native Greece have been frozen. Her father, Alexandros, was among those detained by the Belgian authorities in Brussels on Friday, but her lawyer, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, said he had been released without charge.

The case has sent shock waves through the bloc’s seat in Brussels, a place more associated with policy statements and bureaucrats than police raids and bags of cash.

The European Parliament called for a vote on Tuesday to strip Ms. Kaili of her title as vice president. It also suspended a planned vote on legislation that would have paved the way for Qataris to receive highly coveted visas upon arrival in the European Union. Those visas are said to have been a main focus of the lobbying campaign and alleged bribery.

Qataris need to apply for a visa before visiting the European Union and face a relatively lengthy process. The proposed new visa rules would enable them to get a visa upon arrival in an E.U. country, permitting them to stay for up to three months — a significant easing of the rules on visitors from the small Gulf state.

Despite Qatar’s rejection of the claims against it, the drama in Brussels is reverberating globally. The scandal may prove especially troubling for the Qatari government at a moment when its officials might prefer to be celebrating a crowning achievement: hosting the World Cup. The gas-rich country has been working toward the event, which concludes on Sunday, for more than a decade.  Despite a barrage of critical coverage from Western media, and protests from human rights groups focusing on the authoritarian state’s exploitation of migrant workers and its criminalization of homosexuality, Qatari officials say it has been worth it. The event has brought fans from around the world to the nation of three million people.

Government officials hoped the exposure would not only raise their country’s international profile but also help battle stereotypes about Qataris, and more broadly Arabs and Muslims. Yet depending on how the E.U. case unfolds, it could reinforce the perception of critics in Europe and North America that Qatar has bought its space on the world stage.

Last month, Ms. Kaili spoke fawningly about Qatar’s labor reforms ahead of the World Cup launch; she also visited Doha in November and praised the nation’s preparations for the sporting event.

“The World Cup in Qatar is proof, actually, of how sports diplomacy can achieve a historical transformation of a country with reforms that inspired the Arab world,” Ms. Kaili said during a debate in Parliament. “Still, some here are calling to discriminate [against] them. They bully them, and they accuse everyone that talks to them or engages of corruption.”

The European Parliament is the least powerful of the three key E.U. institutions, but as the Qatar case shows, its members can be active and visible.

On Monday, a more powerful E.U. institution, the European Commission, was in an awkward spot. The commission has adopted an enthusiastic public stance toward Qatar as it scours the earth to secure energy sources to replace the Russian oil and gas lost since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Margaritis Schinas, the commission’s vice president, for example, recently visited Qatar and has been praising the country’s reforms on social media. “Qatar, the first Arab and the smallest country ever to host the Cup, delivered reforms & merits a global success,” he wrote on Twitter last month.

Qatar has been identified as a key source of liquefied natural gas, which the E.U. needs to get through this and future winters’ Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, deflected questions about the investigation, but noted that “we work with Qatar on regional issues such as peace and stability in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and on bilateral issues, such as diversification away from Russian fossil fuels.”

Asked whether the Belgian police had reached out to the commission, Ms. von der Leyen deferred to her staff; a spokesman for the institution later said it was up to the Belgian authorities to say whether they were investigating it.

Ms. von der Leyen vowed to scrutinize records of Commission members’ meetings and travels. But ultimately, she said, “as long as there is no new information, we are at the status quo.”

Ms. Metsola, the European lawmaker who lamented the scandal on Monday, had a different take.

“We would rather be cold than bought,” she said.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/eu-qatar-corruption.html
1;The E.U. imposes fresh sanctions on Iranians over supplying drones to Russia.;"The European Union condemned Iran’s military partnership with Russia on Monday as a gross violation of international law and announced new sanctions against eight Iranian individuals and entities over their role in supplying drones that Moscow has used to attack Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.

Iranian-made drones have been used “indiscriminately by Russia against Ukrainian civilian population and infrastructure causing horrendous destruction and human suffering,” the European Council, the E.U.’s top decision-making body, said in a statement that broadly condemned Iran’s human rights record.

Russia has deployed Iranian-made drones in Ukraine since August, according to U.S. officials, to attack infrastructure as well as military targets. On Saturday, Russian forces used Iranian drones to knock out power to more than 1.5 million people in the port city of Odesa, far from the front lines.

The four individuals facing new E.U. sanctions include the commander in chief of the Iranian Air Force, the head of a weapons research and development unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and a Revolutionary Guard officer who organized a drone demonstration for Russian forces in August.

The entities added to the sanctions list include what the European Council described as a “front company” involved in the development of drones used by Russia, as well as a company that the council says produced drone engines.

The bloc previously imposed sanctions on Iranians over the drone deliveries. In October, the European Union imposed restrictions on the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s air force and Shahed Aviation Industries, the company responsible for designing and developing the drones.

More than 1,350 individuals and entities have been subject to an asset freeze and travel ban by the bloc since 2014 over actions that “undermined Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.” Iran’s military support for Russia has come under heightened international scrutiny in recent weeks, although the Kremlin has denied using the Iranian-made drones to attack civilians, and Tehran maintains that all drone deliveries took place before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.

The Biden administration said on Friday that the two countries were forming a “full-fledged defense partnership” that was expected to intensify in the coming months, while British officials warned that Russia was seeking hundreds of ballistic weapons from Iran in exchange for “an unprecedented level of military and technical support.”

The European Union strongly advised Iran on Monday that any new weapon deliveries to Russia — in particular any movement toward delivering short-range ballistic weapons — would be considered “a serious escalation.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/russia-iran-ukraine-drones-eu-sanctions.html
1;Putin Skips Annual News Conference, Avoiding Possible Questions on War;"It has been an annual ritual of Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia: The president holds a wide-ranging, marathon news conference in December, making a somewhat choreographed show of openness to questioning and demonstrating his command of an array of topics.

But after a series of military setbacks in his war in Ukraine, with Russia’s casualties mounting and its economy faltering under sanctions, Mr. Putin has decided to skip the tradition. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, did not offer a reason when he told reporters during a daily briefing on Monday that the event would not take place this month; he held out the possibility that it might be rescheduled for the new year.

Mr. Putin first held the year-end news conference in 2001, two years into his presidency. He suspended the practice after becoming prime minister in 2008, but resumed it after returning to the presidency in 2012. The last time he opted out of the event, as president, was in 2005.

Often stretching to four hours or more, the December news conference has been one of the few times during the year when reporters outside the Kremlin pool, including foreign correspondents, get the chance to directly question Mr. Putin — if they are called on. But the Kremlin has also asked reporters ahead of time what they might be inclined to ask Mr. Putin.

The ranks of journalists in Russia who are not subservient to the government are thinner than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union, and this year the government criminalized criticism of the war or the military. Independent Russian news media have all either shut down or moved abroad, and many foreign news outlets have been forced out of the country as well.

Even so, it would have been possible for either a Russian or an international reporter to detail some of the setbacks in Ukraine and to ask Mr. Putin embarrassing questions about them — live on national television.

Mr. Peskov noted that Mr. Putin “regularly speaks to the press, including on foreign visits,” but such exchanges are limited to the pool of reporters regularly assigned to the Kremlin.
Political analysts had various reactions, from suggesting Mr. Putin had no future vision to offer, to the idea that he was finding some of his customs monotonous. One of them, Tatiana Stanovaya, wrote on her Telegram channel that the cancellation was a sign Mr. Putin did not want to engage with what he considered to be minor domestic matters or to answer boring or routine questions.

Mikhail Vinogradov, the political scientist who heads the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, said the move contributed to a general sense of stagnation in the country. Even though a lot is happening, he said, calling off the event captures the feeling that “the situation on pause.” The invasion that Mr. Putin ordered in February has left Russia increasingly isolated, economically and politically, as Western nations and others have rallied around Ukraine, showing a rare unity of purpose that they demonstrated again with a series of diplomatic moves on Monday.

Leaders of the Group of 7 wealthy democracies held a video meeting and vowed to help rebuild Ukraine, which has suffered widespread physical devastation, as well as continue to arm it. They said a new body to coordinate international economic and reconstruction aid — akin to the one operating for months to organize military aid — could meet for the first time as soon as January. A broader international conference on aid for Ukraine will be held in Paris on Tuesday. “We firmly support efforts to secure Ukraine’s immediate financial stability and its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable, prosperous and democratic future,” the G7 nations said in a joint statement.

Addressing the meeting by video link, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine focused primarily on his country’s need for more weaponry, but also said, “We must be more active with reconstruction.”

European Union foreign ministers held a separate meeting on Monday and agreed to increase a fund reimbursing countries for war mat?riel provided to Ukraine to 5.5 billion euros (nearly $5.8 billion) from 3.5 billion euros.

Russian bombardment has crippled Ukraine’s energy systems, knocking out power, heat and sometimes water to millions of people at a time, raising fears of a cold, deadly winter.

Military analysts say the increasingly harsh weather could also allow the warring armies to return to more intense frontline combat. The autumn rains reduced dirt roads and fields to bogs, slowing military movement, but the ground is freezing solid again.

The most intense fighting has been in the eastern Donbas region, where Ukraine claimed to have struck a blow against the Wagner Group, the mercenary corps headed by Yevgheny V. Prigozhin, a close ally of Mr. Putin’s, which has operated in concert with the Russian military. Ukrainian officials said that on Sunday, their forces had fired a missile that hit a hotel housing Wagner fighters in Kadiivka, a small city in Luhansk Province. The exiled head of the Ukrainian regional administration in Luhansk Province, Serhiy Haidai, said in a post on the Telegram app that “many” members of the Wagner force had been killed, which could not be confirmed. There was no statement from Wagner.

Mr. Putin has tried to present life in Russia as business as usual for most people, an image that has become harder to maintain. Thousands of troops have been killed or wounded, which generally goes unmentioned in state media. A mismanaged call-up of about 300,000 military conscripts this fall prompted demonstrations and spurred thousands of men to flee the country; Ukrainian officials predict that another Russian draft is coming soon.

A news conference could expose Mr. Putin to questions about casualties, conscription or specific battlefield setbacks like the strike against Wagner or the retreat from the captured city of Kherson. He continues to insist that the war in Ukraine is going according to plan.

Mr. Putin’s annual news conference usually unrolls in a circuslike atmosphere, with reporters waving signs containing some of the Russian leader’s signature phrases, or wearing costumes from their native regions, in the hope of catching his eye and getting to ask a question. The sessions are a set piece on his calendar, a chance for Mr. Putin to display his command of the facts affecting all aspects of Russian life, and ostensibly, to show him as being receptive to all queries.

Mr. Putin prefers scripted events, however, and in the past week he made several highly staged public appearances aimed at reinforcing his version of reality, at a time when a Russian victory in Ukraine appears as distant as ever. Those televised events presented Mr. Putin as a decisive leader, still fully in charge.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/putin-skips-news-conference.html
1;6 Dead, Including 2 Officers, After Shootout in Rural Australia;"MELBOURNE, Australia — Two police officers and a bystander were killed in a shootout that erupted during an investigation into a missing-person case in the Australian state of Queensland, the police said on Tuesday, with one official describing the officers’ death as a “ruthless” execution.

Three other people, believed to have been the attackers, were later shot and killed by the police, officials said.

Much was still unknown about the circumstances surrounding the killings, which occurred on Monday at a remote rural property in the Western Downs area. But at a news conference in Chinchilla, Queensland, the state police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, called the events “complex and horrendous.”

“This event is the largest loss of police life we have suffered in a single incident in many years,” Commissioner Carroll said, adding, “It is going to take us a number of days, if not weeks, to unravel every single aspect of the scene.”

The shootings occurred after four police officers went to the property in Wieambilla, a tiny community about a three-hour drive west of Brisbane, to investigate a report of a missing person, Nathaniel Train, a former school principal from New South Wales, according to the authorities.

The officers jumped the fence and were immediately met by a “hail of gunshots,” Ian Leavers, the president of the Queensland Police Union, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Officers Matthew Arnold, 26, and Rachel McCrow, 29, were hit and fell to the ground, where they were shot and killed by three people on the property, he said in a statement. Mr. Leavers called it a “ruthless, calculated and targeted execution.”

A third officer, Randell Kirk, 27, who was wounded, was able to escape and call for reinforcements. A fourth officer, Keeley Brough, 28, who had joined the police force just eight weeks ago, took cover in long grass, Mr. Leavers said.

“They lit the grass on fire to try and coax her out,” he said. “She actually believed that she was either going to be shot or she was going to be burned alive.”

Officers Brough and Kirk were hospitalized. Information on their conditions was not immediately available.

A man who lived nearby, Alan Dare, 58, went to investigate the grass fire and was “shot in the back in cold blood,” Mr. Leavers said.

Two men and a woman who are believed to have shot the officers and Mr. Dare were later killed by the police, officials said. The three were heavily armed, Commissioner Carroll said, adding, “There’s considerable weaponry involved in what took place there.”

Officials did not release the names of the people killed by the police, but Australian news outlets reported that two of them were Mr. Train, the missing former principal, and his brother Gareth Train. A spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Education said on Tuesday that one of its former employees was among the dead.

According to the New South Wales police, family members in the state had last seen Mr. Train, 46, a year ago, but he maintained contact with them until October. They had “serious concerns” about his welfare after failing to reach him, and they reported him missing on Dec. 4, the police said.

In a post on Twitter on Monday night, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia described the day’s events as “heartbreaking.” He added, “My condolences to all who are grieving tonight — Australia mourns with you.”

Multiple fatal shootings are extremely rare in Australia, which imposed strict gun laws after a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996, in which 35 people were killed. Twenty-two members of the police force, out of roughly 58,500 sworn officers, were killed between 2010 and 2021, according to research from Bond University in Queensland. Of those 22, five officers were killed by armed offenders.

The shooting in Queensland took place close to a small white bungalow, which the Australian news media reported had been owned by two of the attackers, one of whom had been reported missing a year earlier. Aerial footage from the aftermath of the shootings showed what appeared to be smoke still rising from a scrubby area of remote forest, as well as a burned-out police vehicle.

Terry Goldsworthy, an expert on policing in Australia at Bond University and a 28-year veteran of the Queensland force, said there were many unusual aspects to the incident, including the police’s decision to send four officers to investigate a missing-person case, rather than two.

He also said there appeared to be “an element of planning” in the attack on the officers. “It wasn’t just a matter of shooting the police to keep them away: It was a matter of shooting the police as they were going down a driveway, and then shooting them again at close range, removing their weapons,” he said. “Very, very unusual.”

The Western Downs region has a population of about 35,000 people spread over 15,000 square miles, roughly the size of Switzerland, or twice the size of Massachusetts.

1;Day 13: For a Celebrated Chef, the Tastes and Smells of St. Lucia Day in Sweden Linger;"I love the holidays, especially through the lens of food as a chef. I came to Sweden from Ethiopia when I was very young, so while my own holiday traditions started with my adoptive mom and older sisters, I have always been fascinated by how people celebrate throughout the world.

Some of my own earliest memories of growing up in Sweden are of the tastes and smells of Dec. 13, St. Lucia Day. The Feast of St. Lucia is widely celebrated throughout Scandinavia in schools, churches and homes. For my family, it was a time to come together over good food.

The meal was always a grand smorgasbord piled high with herring, gravlax and meatballs. Sometimes we had turkey, other times roasted pork. We had the traditional saffron buns studded with raisins or almonds; each person had their preference. But the one thing we could all agree on — kids and adults alike — were the gingersnaps. There had to be gingersnaps at our St. Lucia Day feast.

Growing up in Goteborg, I was always in the kitchen with my grandmother. Cooking with Grandma Helga laid the foundation for my culinary aspirations, and on St. Lucia Day, there was something magical about that time spent together. I can still feel the oven heat and the smell of the spices wash over me, the exciting moment the warm gingersnaps were baked and ready to be devoured.

There’s nothing quite like the chill of Scandinavian winter, which means there’s nothing better than finding warmth during the holiday season. For me, that was — and still is — all the family, a crackling fire, and a hot cup of glogg: red wine infused with star anise, cloves, cinnamon and orange peel.

The holiday season is a busy time for everyone in the kitchen — home cooks and professional chefs alike. For me, this year will be particularly busy because I’m in the midst of opening my new restaurant in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood. Hav & Mar draws inspiration in part from my Scandinavian roots, so I’ve been able to return to the amazing food and drink of St. Lucia Day and holiday seasons past. In that spirit, we will have glogg and gingersnaps on the winter menu — so that we can welcome people in from the cold to create memories of their own.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/style/marcus-samuelsson-chef-st-lucia-day-sweden-tradition.html
1;‘There Must Be More Room for Africa,’ Leader of African Union Says;"DAKAR, Senegal — Since he took the helm of the African Union, Macky Sall, who is also president of the West African nation of Senegal, has been making the argument that Africa does not have the influence it warrants in world affairs.

Africa is still “confined to the margins,” he said at the United Nations General Assembly in September.

But as he prepared to make his case again at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington this week, it appeared that at least part of his message had been heard: A White House official said President Biden would support a permanent spot in the Group of 20 major economies for the African Union.

In the presidential palace in Dakar last Thursday, surrounded by paintings and sculptures of Senegal’s national symbol, the lion — as well as what looked like a real stuffed lioness — President Sall laid out what Africa hoped to get out of the summit.

(This conversation was edited and condensed for clarity.)

Tell me about your vision for a new international order, in which Africa is no longer sidelined.

This is a vast continent, with 1.4 billion inhabitants and a GDP of $2.7 trillion. But Africa is still at the periphery. When we’re deciding the world’s fate, there must be more room for Africa. At the G20. At the United Nations Security Council.

We need to consolidate the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world, especially with developed countries. Developed and developing countries need to communicate more. That’s my fight. We must be part of solutions and not just a subject, a topic of discussion. And is the G20 ready to give the African Union a seat? Is the U.N. ready to give Africa a permanent seat at the Security Council?

For the G20, I think it’s on track. Already, we have significant support. France, China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have already given their support.

For the United Nations Security Council, the debate is more difficult. In Africa, we are 54 countries. We want two permanent seats with the right to veto. That’s our position.

The current system was defined in 1946. It’s time we looked at the current global configuration. Today’s world cannot continue to function as in 1946. Almost the entire African continent, with the exception of Ethiopia, was under colonization then. We had no freedom.

We are asking for inclusive governance. Otherwise, the system will no longer be credible. But those who must accept it are, first of all, the five permanent members who have the privilege of the right of veto. It’s difficult. But representation needs to be improved.

Mr. President, how do you think this could work? Would a permanent seat at the Security Council —

Two seats!

Two seats. Would they be given to Nigeria, for example, as Africa’s biggest country?

We’re not there yet. It is up to Africa, once it has its seats, to define the modalities of representation. There are several hypotheses. It makes no sense to give them to a particular country. We will have fought for nothing, because the country will represent itself, not Africa. Afterward, between Africans, we can look at what is the best way of representation that makes it possible to defend the interests of the continent. First, we’ll have the seats, then we’ll discuss how to occupy them.

I believe after your remarks at the U.N., President Biden said he supports your call for a Security Council seat — I think he said one, not two.

He can say one seat. I say two seats. It’s a negotiation. [Laughs]

How do you think the president and his government can best support Africa in its fight to move beyond the margins?

I think the president has this desire to work with Africa. It’s clear. Once, he told me that if he is president, it’s largely thanks to the African American vote. That’s something he has in his heart.

But we need more concrete things, and the United States as the world’s most powerful country can stimulate this, if there is the political will. They need to agree to invest a little more in the continent. Not aid, but investment. We’re not asking for handouts. What we are asking is to be able to access markets, and that there is not too much tension resulting in increased prices of wheat, of fertilizer, as we have experienced this year. This forced our states to subsidize, when we’re already suffering a lot from Covid and from the war in Ukraine. What would success at the Washington summit look like?

Success would be for the United States and Africa to work on a concrete program to offer food security, to help Africa to be self-sufficient through public-private investment funds, to help modernize agriculture in Africa and to develop infrastructure: energy, roads, railways and irrigation. Certainly, we’ll need a little money, but first, there must be the will to work with Africans.

What can the United States offer Africa that other partners — like China, Russia or Turkey — can’t, and vice versa?

What, for example, China does that the West does not do in Africa is — it’s one of the few countries that funds basic infrastructure. Roads, railways, major infrastructure. The other [Western] countries did it for a long time, but 30 years ago, they stopped, and now the focus is on financing software, governance, defense, gender. Education and health too. Financing vaccines, health and education is an excellent thing. But at the same time, Africa needs roads, railways, energy.

When it comes to Ukraine, do you think that world powers are asking African countries to pick sides? And you have yourself spoken to Vladimir Putin; how do you think this war could end?

This war must end. For us Africans, that’s the most important thing, not aligning ourselves behind Russia or Ukraine — even if we’ve said that countries’ borders must be respected.

With President Zelensky [last week], I spoke at length about [the initiative] Grain from Ukraine. We told him, ‘That’s a great thing. We will continue to work with you. But talk, agree to a cease-fire, work for peace.’

In the end, saying that Russia is guilty does not solve the problem. Beyond naming a culprit, the war must be stopped. Everyone is suffering today. We see all the consequences of this war on the standard of living, on the price of hydrocarbons, oil, food. So stop it.

You are often criticized here in Senegal for not confirming that you will not run again as a presidential candidate in 2024. Do you hear those criticisms?

It is normal for me to be criticized in my political action, not just in my work as president.

It is clear that today there is no legal debate [over whether or not he can run again]. Now, whether I’m going to be a candidate or not, it’s my decision.

Have you decided?

When I decide, I’ll let the Senegalese people know.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/africa/african-union-macky-sall-senegal-summit.html
1;Eldest BTS Member, Jin, Enlists in South Korean Army;"SEOUL — The day that many fans of BTS had hoped would never come has arrived. Jin, the eldest member of the K-pop supergroup, started his military service on Tuesday, fulfilling a pledge that ended a debate about South Korea’s mandatory conscription.

The enlistment of the singer, whose birth name is Kim Seok-jin, marks a pause for one of the biggest boy bands in the world, with other members expected to follow him into the armed forces. The band’s management has said that the group would reconvene “around 2025.”

Mr. Kim, who turned 30 on Dec. 4, posted a selfie on social media Sunday night featuring his freshly shorn hair. “Cuter than expected,” he captioned it.

On Tuesday, he entered a military training center in Yeoncheon County in Gyeonggi Province, near the border with North Korea. Fans and reporters gathered outside, hoping to catch a glimpse of the idol in one of the dozens of cars entering the compound, despite requests from BTS’s label that they stay away. Guards patrolled the front gate while wardens directed traffic, local media videos showed.

Mr. Kim, the Defense Ministry said, is expected to finish his service in June 2024.

South Korea’s mandatory military service, which applies to all able-bodied men over the age of 18, is seen as crucial to the country’s defense against North Korea. But debate has raged for years in both the public and legislative spheres about whether BTS should be exempt from conscription given its contributions to South Korea’s economy and soft power abroad.

In a nod to the band’s global success, South Korea’s Parliament revised the law in 2020 to allow cultural and artistic icons to defer their enlistment to the age of 30, giving Mr. Kim two additional years to perform. Otherwise, Korean men are required to enlist in the military by age 28, barring a few exceptions, including for Olympic champions. Bills to exempt the band from service altogether have proved contentious, especially among the cohort of young men for whom conscription is compulsory.

The band put the debate to rest in October this year when its label, Big Hit Music, announced that the members would indeed fulfill their duties in the military.

A few months earlier, in June, BTS had said that it would take a hiatus from group activities, citing the pressure of their stardom and members’ desires to explore solo music careers.

Last week, BTS’s label said that there would be no special send-off events for Jin, and requested the media and “fans to please refrain from visiting the site” of enlistment. Fresh recruits typically kick off their enlistment with a ceremony attended by friends and family.

1;As Covid Spreads Fast, Beijing Isn’t in Lockdown. But It Feels Like It.;"Restaurants have closed because too many staff members have tested positive for Covid. The usually ubiquitous food delivery workers zipping through traffic on their scooters have nearly vanished because of infections. Pharmacies have been emptied of cold medicine, and supermarkets have been running low on the essentials such as disinfectant solution and antibacterial wipes.

Less than a week after the Chinese government lifted its stringent “zero Covid” restrictions, following a spasm of protests across the country, Beijing looks like a city in the throes of a lockdown — this time, self-imposed by residents. Sidewalks and pedestrian shopping streets are barren, and once busy traffic thoroughfares are deserted. Residents are hunkering down indoors and hoarding medicine as a wave of Covid sweeps across the Chinese capital.

“No one dares to come out now,” said Yue Jiajun, a Beijing restaurant owner, who initially celebrated when customers were allowed to dine indoors last week only to learn later that the surge in infections would keep them away.

“Even takeaway, I have no customers,” said Mr. Yue, who admitted that there probably weren’t enough delivery drivers for his orders anyway.

All over the city, residents were gripped by the sinking realization that a virus most of the world had already experienced was spreading freely and rapidly for the first time, three years after it emerged. Weibo, China’s popular social media service, was awash with people around the country sharing news of their infections and their personal experiences with Covid.  “Fifty to 60 percent of my relatives and friends have tested positive,” wrote one person on Weibo, a social media site. Liu Qiangdong, the chief executive of the e-commerce site JD.com, and Wang Shi, a real estate tycoon, shared on Weibo their experiences about recovering from Covid. A virus-stricken Zhang Lan, the founder of a popular restaurant chain, South Beauty Group, summoned the energy to hawk vitamin supplements and sausage as potential remedies on a livestream.

“I’m here to encourage you,” Ms. Zhang told her viewers. “Adjust your mentality, drink plenty of water. You’ll be fine.”

Rapid antigen tests are now one of the hottest commodities in town after they were all but sold out at stores. Medicine has also become hard to find, either at hospital clinics or at pharmacies. Many residents complain that the city should have done more to anticipate the Covid outbreak and to stockpile drugs ahead of time.

“The most urgent issue is the shortage of medicine,” said a 25-year-old Beijing resident who gave only his family name, Wang, given the political sensitivity of the issue.

Mr. Wang said that he developed a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a sore throat on Saturday morning and became dizzy. He tested positive for coronavirus on a rapid antigen test at home and went to a fever clinic at a hospital.

“I don’t know if I’m doing it right at home, so I came to the hospital to find out if there are any precautions,” Mr. Wang said, adding that he tried to obtain ibuprofen, a painkiller, and a popular herbal remedy called Lianhua Qingwen that has been the subject of price gouging.

The doctor instead prescribed loxoprofen, a different painkiller, and Ganmao Qingre granules, a less coveted herbal remedy. “Many medicines in great demand are not available now, and I don’t know if other medicines prescribed can have the same effect,” Mr. Wang said. Vincent Chen said he resorted to begging friends outside Beijing to send him fever medication after he couldn’t find any at his local pharmacies or online. He had to splurge on an express delivery company because ordinary services were either too busy or didn’t have enough staff.

“Couriers are paralyzed,” said Mr. Chen, 35.

Others have caught on. Tutorials are now spreading on Weibo teaching city dwellers how to purchase drugs from pharmacies in the countryside.

The hoarding of remedies isn’t limited to cough medicine and lozenges. Stores are now running out of jarred peaches because they’re believed to be packed with enough nutrients to ward off the virus. The sweet snack is popular in northeastern China for treating cold symptoms, but it now appears to be winning converts elsewhere as people try to gain an edge on the illness. State media has had to weigh in, declaring there’s no proof peaches make a difference.

It wasn’t the only time in the last week the government has had to step in to try to calm a frenzy over an elixir. The State Administration for Market Regulation, a market watchdog, warned producers and retailers about runaway prices after Lianhua Qingwen, the herbal remedy, started selling at more than triple its regular price.

“It is strictly forbidden to drive up prices,” the regulator said on Friday.

Shares of Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical, the maker of Lianhua Qingwen, have jumped more than 20 percent on the Shenzhen stock market since Covid restrictions were relaxed.

The shortages don’t appear to have extended to food. Beijing has repeatedly promised that groceries would remain adequate through the pandemic. The capital, given its political importance, has traditionally had priority for food supplies.

Large piles of oranges, corn, cabbage and other produce were still available at supermarkets in the city that were able to round up enough staff to remain open. The only sections with dwindling inventory were for cleaning products and booze as customers tried to hedge how much time they’d need to stay indoors.

Other businesses aren’t so fortunate as grocery stores. China tried to revitalize its travel industry last week by ending the many restrictions on travel between provinces. But some Beijing hotels have stopped admitting new guests because they have too few staff to look after them.  The severity of Beijing’s outbreak is hard to discern. China’s mass testing system is being dismantled, so the number of infections is unknown. The city recorded 559 confirmed cases and 468 asymptomatic infections on Monday. That’s down from 1,163 confirmed cases and 3,503 asymptomatic infections on Dec. 5, the last day authorities required a negative test to enter public spaces.

Other available data suggests a city experiencing a surge in cases. Li Ang, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, said at a news conference on Monday that the number of calls for emergency services on Friday was six times higher than normal and that visits to fever clinics had increased 16-fold in a week.

One of the biggest questions is whether China can maintain medical care for people who fall seriously ill with Covid or who have unrelated conditions requiring treatment. Beijing, with some of the country’s best hospitals, has an advantage over rural areas. The city appealed on Saturday for people not to call the medical emergency hotline if they were asymptomatic or had only mild cases.

Several older people leaving a hospital in the Dongcheng district on Saturday said in separate interviews that they had received treatment, including for kidney dialysis and an injured foot. But a 66-year-old man, complaining about a week of chronic pain at the base of his back, said that he had been turned away because the emergency room was full. The man, who gave only his family name, Gao, given the political sensitivity in discussing China’s pandemic response, said that he would try again later.

“I am still in pain,” he said. “I will come again.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/asia/china-covid-zero-beijing.html
1;Europe Reaches Deal for Carbon Tax Law on Imports;"The European Union has taken a step closer to adopting a groundbreaking carbon tax law that would impose a tariff on imports from countries that fail to take strict steps to curb their greenhouse gas emissions.

E.U. member states and the European Parliament reached a preliminary agreement on the proposed law on Monday night, and while the bill has yet to undergo legal checks and get final approval, E.U. officials said they expected it to easily clear the final hurdles.

“A historic agreement,” said Pascal Canfin, the chair of the Parliament’s Environment Committee. “We are putting carbon and climate at the heart of trade.”

The “carbon border adjustment mechanism” is aimed at protecting E.U. companies subjected to strict environmental rules from the risk of being crushed by competition with businesses from countries whose rules on emissions are looser. It is also designed to encourage other countries to adopt similarly ambitious emissions rules.

The European Union has for years had a program that charges companies for the pollutants they emit to encourage them to cut emissions. Companies can emit carbon dioxide until a set cap, above which they must buy permits and pay for the extra pollutants they release. Sectors covered include iron and steel, cement, aluminum and fertilizers.

Under the new law, which European officials say will be the first of its kind in the world, only countries adopting similar emissions curbs would be able to export to E.U. countries without paying additional fees. The aim, officials say, is a level playing field for carbon pricing.

The United States is looking at similar legislation, and last week the Biden administration sent a proposal to the European Union to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum produced in ways that harm the environment as part of efforts to tackle climate change.

The E.U. law is part of an ambitious environmental package aimed at cutting emissions to at least 55 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. This weekend, member states and members of the European Parliament are set to discuss phasing out allowances that the current carbon pricing system grants to some E.U. industries exposed to competition. This would avoid the new law giving those industries a double benefit, in violation of World Trade Organization rules.

Though some companies might want to keep their current allowances, E.U. officials said they were confident that they had enough support to push the package ahead.

The new law is expected to be approved by member states by the end of the year and the European Parliament in early 2023. The plan would be implemented starting in October next year, with a transition period until 2026 or 2027 to give companies time to prepare.

The law would potentially affect some E.U. trade partners in the targeted sectors, like Turkey, China, Britain and to a lesser level the United States, and critics there have opposed it. The Chinese leader Xi Jinping said that climate change should not be “an excuse for trade barriers,” according to the state media outlet Xinhua.

But Mr. Canfin dismissed the criticism.

“It’s not trade protectionism, it’s a level playing field,” he said, adding that trade would create incentives that international climate conferences were “not enough” to achieve. “What we are saying to Turkey or China is just: Put a carbon price.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/europe/eu-carbon-tax-law-imports.html
1;Banksy’s works near Kyiv have inspired Ukraine. But did one activist go too far?;"KYIV, Ukraine — Many Ukrainians saw messages of defiance and resilience in the seven artworks painted last month by Banksy, the British street artist, on war-ravaged buildings in and around Kyiv.

At least one activist saw another kind of benefit: He removed one of the works, saying he intended to auction it and donate the proceeds to the Ukrainian Army.

The activist, Serhiy Dovhyi, says he is now under criminal investigation for removing the work from a wall in the Kyiv suburb of Hostomel. The depiction, of a woman in a bathrobe wearing a gas mask and holding a fire extinguisher, suggests the war’s intrusion on home life. A Ukrainian art dealer has estimated that the work is worth up to $1 million.

Under wartime authorities, the Ukrainian military appoints local leaders. The military-appointed head of Hostomel told local media that the art should go into a future memorial to war or remain on the site, to become part of a future building.

It isn’t the first time ownership of one of Banksy’s works has been in dispute. In 2014, a Banksy painting appeared on a piece of plywood secured to the Broad Plain Boys Club in Bristol, England. The club’s owner, Dennis Stinchcombe, planned to auction the painting to raise money for the club, but the city stepped in and claimed it owned the depiction of a couple embracing and staring at their cellphones. In a rare public move, Banksy wrote a letter saying the art should be used to help the club.  In the Ukraine dispute, Mr. Dovhyi said in an interview that the artwork had to be saved because the wall on which it was painted was scheduled to be demolished soon. He described the act of removing the graffiti, which he documented in videos, as an additional act of performance art that might add to its value.

Mr. Dovhyi cut the graffiti from the wall in Hostomel on Dec. 2 by removing a layer of insulation on the ruined building’s exterior. .

“Street art, in contrast to a piece of art in the Louvre, doesn’t belong to anyone,” he said. The action did, in any case, succeed in stirring discussion in Ukraine about the future of Banksy’s local works. The art appeared in the suburban towns Hostomel, Irpin and Borodyanka, where hundreds of civilians died early in the war in air and artillery strikes and summary executions.

For nearly two decades, Banksy has maintained his anonymity, while creating art, often with social and political undertones, in New York City, London, the West Bank and many other places.

Banksy’s work has also included stunts. In 2018, his painting “Girl With Balloon” self-destructed in a remote-controlled shredder moments after Sotheby’s in London auctioned it for $1.4 million. The apparent commentary on the excesses of the art market only enhanced the work’s value: Retitled “Love Is in the Bin,” Sotheby’s resold it last year for $25.4 million.

But Banksy also goes to great lengths to regulate the resale of his graffiti and prevent fakes, working with a team that authenticates his work. Reputable dealers and auction houses sell Banksy works only with certification.

Banksy has already sold art to benefit Ukraine. In March, he donated proceeds from the sale of a painting to the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv.

Mr. Dovhyi argued that the army’s needs during wartime justified the attempt to sell the painting of the woman in the bathrobe. “I wanted to capitalize as much as possible,” he said, “and all the money would go to humanitarian and military purposes.”

But the police turned up soon after he had cut the art from the wall, confiscating the slab of insulation and questioning Mr. Dovhyi and others in his group. Mr. Dovhyi said police told him the investigation is under an article of the criminal code that deals with property damage less severe than vandalism. He has not been charged.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/europe/banksy-ukraine-kyiv.html
1;Belarus says it is checking its army’s combat readiness. Analysts see little chance it will join Russia’s fight.;"Belarus said on Tuesday that its army was assessing its combat readiness, a move that comes as the country has faced pressure to provide further support for Russia’s forces in Ukraine.

Military experts say it is highly unlikely that Belarus will send troops to Ukraine, not least because it would be deeply unpopular domestically, but they say that President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus may be giving the impression of combat readiness in order to force Ukraine to divert troops from other fronts.

Mr. Lukashenko is a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and Belarus relies on Moscow for finance, fuel and security assistance. Moscow used eastern Belarus as a staging ground when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. The United States and European governments have imposed sanctions on both countries.

A Belarusian Defense Ministry statement said that “a sudden check of combat readiness has begun” on the orders of Mr. Lukashenko.

As part of its preparations, Belarus’s troops will have to move to predetermined locations and test their equipment, organize security and defense and build bridges across the Neman and Berezina rivers, the Defense Ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

The Neman river runs through Lithuania and eventually drains into the Baltic Sea, while the Berezina joins the Dnipro River around 40 miles north of the Ukrainian border. The exercises would not directly approach the frontier between Belarus and Ukraine, which is around 670 miles long.

In October, Mr. Lukashenko said that Russian troops would return to his country in large numbers, and in recent weeks drones have been launched from Belarus against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and other targets. In addition, supplies of military equipment have been ferried by Russian forces from Belarus to their troops in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Ukrainian forces are already fighting in the south and east. In light of the potential threat from the north, Andriy Demchenko, a spokesman of Ukraine’s State Border Guard Service, said on Tuesday that the country was strengthening its defenses along the length of its border with Belarus. He said the situation is under control.

“We can clearly see how Russia is putting pressure on Belarus to join the full-scale war,” he said on a Ukrainian telethon.

The Surprising Health Benefits of Bird-Watching

How a Hotel Was Converted into Housing for Formerly Homeless People
Ukraine in recent weeks began to build a wall and trench system along the frontier in the northwestern province of Volyn, though analysts say that it is more likely to stop migrants crossing rather than for a military purpose.

The Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said in a report this week that Belarus is “extraordinarily unlikely to invade Ukraine in the foreseeable future.”

Instead, it said that Mr. Lukashenko and other officials in Belarus have assisted with an effort by Moscow to suggest that Belarus will join the war directly in an effort to pin down Ukrainian troops on their northern border.

At the same time, the Institute said that Moscow aimed to bind Belarus further into its campaign in Ukraine “as part of a long-term effort to cement further control over Belarus.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/europe/belarus-army-russia-ukraine.html
0;Taking to the Woods With Maine’s ‘Tree Tippers’;"In northern Maine, when the last of the wildflowers go golden on their stems — when the temperatures dip, fishermen pull their traps from the water, hunters wait in the woods and farmers gather the final crops — the time finally comes for “tipping,” or, as the old-timers call it, “brushing.” This is the time of year when folks head into the woods to gather the ends of evergreen branches for use in wreaths and holiday trimmings.

Ten-year-old Harbor Eaton lives with her family on Darthia Farm on Maine’s Schoodic Peninsula. The Eaton family primarily grows produce crops, but balsam-harvesting and wreath-making is a way of extending the farm’s production into the colder, darker seasons. In November and December, Harbor goes out tipping with her family and farm workers on adjacent woodlots, with the aid of their horses, Andy and Starr.

“You go out into the woods, try to find a tree with good foliage. You take a branch, snap it and make sure it doesn’t have brown spots on it — ’cause you don’t want a brown wreath,” Harbor explained.

Cedar, Harbor’s 7-year-old brother, said that the trick is to use a stick that’s sharpened on one end — with four branch stubs sticking out — to stack and collect the boughs into a portable unit. “Do that over and over till you have filled the stick with branches,” Cedar said. “Then you put the stick on the wagon. You do it all over again until the horses pull us home with all the full sticks.”

Balsam-harvesting is a welcome change of pace for farmers at the end of the season’s crescendo. “After spending the majority of our time focusing our energy on the soil and working looking down, we get into the woods and just stare at the trees, looking up toward the sky,” said Liz Moran, who manages Darthia Farm and raises Harbor and Cedar with her partner, Steve Eaton, known as Shepsi.

The process of tipping is hard work: the physical picking and pulling, the weight of the heavy branches. Tippers also need to keep an ear out for hunters in the forests, and pull off ticks at day’s end. But Ms. Moran describes a certain magic about the work: bringing warm treats to eat, noticing the soft patterns in the branches, letting the children play as they work, listening for the barred owl that lives near the entrance of the woodlot. The crew sometimes sing while they work, their voices echoing off the trees.  “The woods offer such a different acoustic environment than the open gardens and fields,” Mr. Eaton said. “It’s easier to hear each other in the woods if we are singing.”

In Maine, especially in the state’s Downeast region, generations of people have built lives on seasonal, nature-based work: digging clams, pulling traps on commercial fishing boats, raking blueberries, processing seafood and crops. Harvesting balsam and making wreaths play important roles in this cycle.   Geri Valentine started making wreaths in the 1970s, and it’s still a part of her patchwork of seasonal jobs. As she wire-wrapped handfuls of evergreen around metal rings in a cozy cabin on Darthia Farm, she recalled her early days as a wreather. “Back then, it was mostly a cottage industry — people would go out in family groups to gather brush,” she said. “People like clam diggers and fishermen would go out brushing after the fishing season was over, and it was a way to bring in some income, especially right before Christmas, heading into the lean months.”

Ms. Valentine has chosen a simple life. She lives in a cabin in the town of Addison without electricity and running water; she grows her own food with friends; she drives a used car. “I don’t want very much,” she said. “I change my jobs with the seasons.” “Living this way feels very grounded,” she continued. These days, though, people can’t survive as easily on seasonal work, she said. “If you have a truck payment, if you’ve got a mortgage, if you want to send your kids to college, you can’t swing a life of digging clams in the summer and making wreaths for Christmastime.”

When you talk to locals, they agree: The systems have changed. The bigger wreath manufacturers, including Kelco Industries, Worcester Wreath Co. and Whitney Wreath, likely made the ones you find at your local grocery store or in catalogs. By some estimates, such companies employ about 2,000 migrant workers to harvest materials and work in wreath factories in Downeast Maine — often the same workers who harvested wild blueberries in summer and who returned to Maine for wreath season. Among the migrant workers, there have been growing concerns about low wages, substandard housing, exploitative work conditions and a lack of access to health care and education. Nonprofits like Mano en Mano and the Maine Farmer and Rancher Stress Assistance Network provide support to seasonal workers, including those employed by the wreath industry.

This year, local nonprofits collaborated with farmers to gather warm clothes, blankets and supplies for wreath workers who are often unprepared for the cold of New England in November and December. Mounds of donated goods piled up at drop-off sites — enough that Bo Dennis, a flower farmer and organizer, borrowed a clean cattle trailer to carry it all to Mano en Mano’s office in Milbridge. Mr. Dennis grows flowers at his farm, Dandy Ram Farm, in Monroe, Maine, and is also on staff at Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, where he works on programs for beginner farmers. He offers his farmland for other queer farmers to find an entry point to agriculture and rural life. He’s tuned in to the networks of people and plants around him and the ways they may need support — and this mind-set extends to the forests.

“When we harvest, we are pruning a tree,” Mr. Dennis said, explaining that tippers only cut the last 12 to 15 inches of a tree branch — a sustainable practice. He loaded heavy bags of boughs into his truck, all harvested from a friend’s woodlot, a chunk of clear-cut land that had grown in with thick, scrubby trees.

Mr. Dennis mainly harvests balsam fir, supplemented with cedar, pine and juniper. He is careful about where he harvests, and on whose land. “As a trans person, I’m hyper-aware that I want to have consent with anything I’m doing, including having consent to the land,” he said. By percentage, Maine is the most forested state in America; about 89 percent of the land is woodlands, most of which is privately owned. Independent tippers usually (but not always) get permission from private landowners to gather materials on their land — and, as with deer hunters or wild mushroom gatherers, tippers often know whom to ask and where to find what they need.

Rachel Alexandrou, a forager and artist who uses the name Giant Daughter, looks in a variety of places: overgrown properties that might benefit from pruning, weedy land, areas with trees too thick for them all to thrive. “I also harvest at abandoned sites,” she said, “like an abandoned Burger King that no one is tending to.” Ms. Alexandrou uses her background in horticulture and farming to influence the ways she gathers her materials. “I don’t want to be taking away,” she said. “I want to be using what makes sense to use.”

“I pay attention to the way the plants are growing so that I know my harvesting is good for the ecosystem I’m harvesting from,” she added.

Most tippers will wait for three hard frosts before they harvest. If you bend a balsam bough in the summer, it won’t snap; after a few frosts, it will. The frost allows the branches to be harvested easily, at the right time in the tree’s growth cycle. This year, though, the frosts were worryingly erratic. It was warm enough to harvest in a T-shirt on some days. Weather patterns, tides, fish, frosts, deer — these can be the favored conversational subjects in rural Maine. Tipping, too, offers common ground.

“I may have nothing to do with someone most of the year,” Mr. Eaton said, “but if I’m tipping, there is much to relate to.”

Every so often, while working in the woods, the tippers stop to smell their hands. They smell like pitch, like the inside of trees. Dirt mingles with the sap. I see it over and over: tippers cupping their palms to their face and pulling pine needles from their hair. The smell is earthy and nostalgic. The wreaths will smell this way, too: joyful circles on front doors across the country, formed by the work of strangers, and made from trees that continue to grow.

0;Elon Musk’s Latest Jab from the Right;"Why Elon Musk might be taking on Anthony Fauci
Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a willingness, and sometimes a relish, to pick public fights with an array of targets, including advertisers, tech giants, employees and more.

But over the weekend, Musk publicly attacked two figures, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, in ways that may resonate with far-right audiences and gin up user engagement — but are likely to deter wary advertisers from flocking back to the social network anytime soon.

“My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,” Musk tweeted on Sunday, scoring points with both critics of the use of nonbinary pronouns and of Mr. Fauci, America’s top immunologist, who disagreed with President Donald Trump on how to reopen the country in 2020. Mr. Musk has previously criticized pandemic lockdowns, having defied one that affected Tesla’s factory in California, and remote work. (Mr. Fauci himself wrote in a Times Opinion guest essay how political divisiveness has hampered public health campaigns.)

Musk’s tweet drew predictable responses, including support from far-right figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and rebukes from Democratic lawmakers like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Some on Twitter noted that Musk’s own predictions about the pandemic fell drastically short of reality.

Mr. Musk also spread misinformation about Mr. Roth, misleadingly suggesting that the former Twitter executive’s doctoral thesis advocated for child sexualization. The move opened up Mr. Roth — whom Mr. Musk had publicly supported in the first days of his Twitter ownership, before Mr. Roth quit — to online abuse.

Musk says that he has focused relentlessly on improving public safety on Twitter, and accused previous management of failing to do so. But Jack Dorsey, the company’s co-founder and former C.E.O., disputed that assertion. And three members of Twitter’s Trust & Safety Council announced their resignation last week, citing the company’s increased reliance on automated content moderation.

Is Musk banking on conservative engagement to help Twitter’s business? Musk has pointed to some metrics showing that user engagement is up since he took over. The billionaire may well be politically conservative, but evidence of his actual positions isn’t very clear. In any case, his actions — which also include leaking internal Twitter correspondence about topics like Hunter Biden to sympathetic journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss — have certainly succeeded in winning over right-leaning users and conservative politicians.

But Mr. Musk’s shock tactics don’t seem to be designed to bring back advertisers who paused spending on Twitter amid the chaos during his takeover. (Apple, which was the target of a brief Musk campaign but which hasn’t halted ads on the platform, declined to comment to DealBook on Musk’s latest tweets.) That puts additional importance on Twitter’s efforts to expand revenue beyond ads, including the revamped Twitter Blue subscription service that is set to debut today.

Covid, inflation and interest rates buffet global markets
December has been a downer for investors so far, and this morning is looking no different. Stock markets from Hong Kong to London are in the red on Monday, as are U.S. futures ahead of a big week of data releases and interest rates decisions.

Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai closed lower on Monday as concerns grow over the rate of Covid infections in major Chinese cities, after Beijing suddenly eased many of its zero-Covid restrictions. That is feeding into global slowdown fears, which are affecting energy prices. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Brent crude was down roughly 0.7 percent.

The S&P 500 Index has fallen in nine of the past 11 trading sessions, as recession and inflation fears mount, pushing investors to pare their stock holdings. The benchmark index slumped 3.4 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since September, according to Deutsche Bank equities analysts.  Energy, bank and tech stocks have been hit particularly hard, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 4 percent so far this month.

Investors are bracing for another volatile week. Markets will be closely watching Tuesday’s latest Consumer Price Index report for signs that consumer inflation has peaked. And on Wednesday, the Fed will announce what is expected to be a 0.5 percentage point interest rate increase. That same afternoon, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, will deliver his latest assessment of the economy, and is expected to signal the central bank’s policy moves for next year.

It’s a similar picture in Europe. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will also deliver rates decisions this week, and similarly sized increases are expected. And investors will be tracking consumer price data releases from France, Germany and the U.K., where soaring energy and food prices have pushed core inflation to multidecade highs.

FTX’s C.E.O. showdown
As two congressional committees gear up to scrutinize the multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto empire FTX this week, its fallen founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, still seems to believe in the future of the company, and in his role as a business leader.

Mr. Bankman-Fried hopes to start a new venture, he told the BBC on Saturday, explaining that the goal would be to repay FTX investors. The comments were made a day after he weighed in on a proposal to revive FTX by issuing a new version of the exchange’s token, FTT, writing on Twitter that it would be “a productive path for parties to explore!” The price of FTT rose on his tweet, but the statements would have come as little consolation to FTX’s million creditors.

“I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” Bankman-Fried warned. He is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, but the former FTX chief executive said there were limits on what he would be able to say because he does not have access to all of his personal or professional data.

It’s not clear whether Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is known as S.B.F., will appear in person. He has also not yet accepted a request to talk to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.

Staying silent may be difficult. The hearing will pit Mr. Bankman-Fried against John Ray, the restructuring expert and current FTX C.E.O. who is managing the bankruptcy and labeled FTX the worst case of corporate failure he had ever seen. S.B.F. has pushed back against that characterization, claiming Mr. Ray made “false” statements in court filings about FTX’s failure.

Mr. Ray reportedly met with Manhattan prosecutors last week. They are apparently looking into suspicious transfers to the Bahamas on the eve of FTX filing for bankruptcy, among other aspects of the collapse.

Other executives are being more circumspect. At least in public. Caroline Ellison, the former C.E.O. of Alameda Research, FTX’s sister trading firm that allegedly used FTX customer funds to back its very risky bets, has stayed quiet — even as Bankman-Fried has tried to shift blame on to her.  Ms. Ellison has reportedly hired a former S.E.C. official steeped in crypto cases, Stephanie Avakian, as her lawyer. Last week, Ms. Ellison was reportedly spotted in a coffee shop not far from the offices of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, giving rise to speculation that she may be cooperating with their investigation.

Here’s what else is happening in crypto today:

South Korean prosecutors believe that the crypto fugitive Do Kwon, who is wanted in the $60 billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna tokens, is hiding in Serbia.

Investors are pulling record amounts from crypto coins following the collapse of FTX. And most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trading lower this morning. ";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/musk-twitter-fauci.html
0;Brain Implants Have Begun to Restore Functions, but Advances Are Slow;"A jumble of cords and two devices the size of soda cans protrude from Austin Beggin’s head when he undergoes testing with a team of researchers studying brain implants that are meant to restore function to those who are paralyzed.

Despite the cumbersome equipment, it is also when Mr. Beggin feels the most free. He was paralyzed from the shoulders down after a diving accident eight years ago, and the brain device picks up the electrical surges that his brain generates as he envisions moving his arm. It converts those signals to cuffs on the major nerves in his arm. They allow him to do things he had not done on his own since the accident, like lift a pretzel to his mouth.

“This is like the first time I’ve ever gotten the opportunity or I’ve ever been privileged and blessed enough to think, ‘When I want to open my hand, I open it,’” Mr. Beggin, 30, said. Days like that are always “a special day.”

The work at the Cleveland Functional Electrical Stimulation Center represents some of the most cutting-age research in the brain-computer interface field, with the team connecting the brain to the arm to restore motion.

It’s a field that Elon Musk wants to advance, announcing in a recent presentation that brain implants from his company Neuralink would someday help restore sight to the blind or return people like Mr. Beggin to “full-body functionality.” Mr. Musk also said the Neuralink device could allow anyone to use phones and other machines with new levels of speed and efficiency.

Neuroscientists and Mr. Beggin alike see such giant advances as decades away, though. Scientists who have approval to test such devices in humans are inching toward restoring normal function in typing, speaking and limited movements. Researchers caution that the goal is much harder and more dangerous than it may seem. And they warn that Mr. Musk’s goals may never be possible — if it is even worth doing in the first place. “It is fun to think about science fiction scenarios describing how the world might be,” said Paul Nuyujukian, a professor of bioengineering and neurosurgery at Stanford University who has spent years working on similar technology. “But given where we are right now with the science, it is not clear how those scenarios will be realized.”

The scientists at the Neuralink event on Nov. 30 and those watching online agreed that the engineering that Mr. Musk showed off was an elegant mash-up of some of the best ideas in the decades-old field. Replacing the soda-can-like protrusion from the head would indeed be a significant advance, they acknowledged.

Neuralink’s device prototype would eliminate that problem, but only after patients undergo robotic surgery to cut a hole in the head slightly larger than a quarter. Then the robot knits 1,024 cobweb-thin electrode tendrils into the gray matter of the brain and rests the puck-like device in the hole.

With work so delicate, some researchers in the field worry that one high-profile misstep could erase years of progress.

“The communications coming out of Neuralink too often sounds like cowboy activity, right?” said Marcus Gerhardt, chief executive of Blackrock Microsystems, a brain-computer interface company that could be a Musk rival.

Mr. Gerhardt said the neurosurgeons affiliated with his company “are petrified every day that something terrible could happen there and affect the rest of the space.”

Mr. Beggin is one of about three dozen people who have a device called a “Utah array” implanted in the brain for research purposes. The device includes a small grid of electrodes that are dipped barely two millimeters into his brain. That is linked to a portal mounted on his head and, via cables, to another computer.

Most of the days Mr. Beggin spends working with the Cleveland research team involve looking at a moving arm or hand on a computer screen and envisioning himself making the same motion. That allows researchers to detect the neuron-firing patterns in his brain that give rise to each movement. Those signals are communicated to a system that manipulates eight nerves in his arm to make it move, said A. Bolu Ajiboye, a professor of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University whose team has been working with patients like Mr. Beggin.

The work can be tedious, Mr. Beggin said, but he finds it worthwhile for the days when he can move his hand. His experience builds on work with a prior volunteer, who was also paralyzed in the arms and legs, and managed to lift a forkful of mashed potatoes to his mouth with the system. Mr. Beggin did not watch the Neuralink presentation last month.  But he said he was dismayed to hear that Mr. Musk raised the notion of “full-body functionality” for people who are paralyzed.

It’s an outcome that, given the painstaking work involved in his hand motions, Mr. Beggin expects will take a generation to achieve.

His mother, Shelly Beggin, agrees. “As a parent, I would love to hear that,” Ms. Beggin said. “I would have held onto that hope that he would be able to walk.”

Realistically, she said, she’s happy to see her son’s hard-won hand motions. Scientists who work on the brain-computer interfaces say that tempering patient expectations is important in a field that has seen stunning progress, but faces daunting challenges.

Academic teams across the nation are working on projects aimed at restoring function to those with disabilities or degenerative diseases. Scientists are working to map the visual center of the brain so points of light can be projected in the mind’s eye to help the blind see shapes and letters. Other teams are working on translating neural electricity into speech, cursor control, handwriting and typing applications.

Several companies, including Neuralink, are working on fully implantable devices. Paradromics, a start-up in Austin, Texas, is developing a device that sits inside the skull. Another company, Synchron, based in New York City, is taking a different approach, making an incision in the chest and pushing a tube-shaped device into an artery close to the brain. This avoids the dangers of brain surgery, but the signal it captures from the brain is considerably weaker, according to Tom Oxley, chief executive of Synchron.  Despite all the promise in the field, scientists say this technology has very little to offer to the typical consumer, as it is merely approaching the speed and precision of able-bodied control.

That seems as if it’s about to change, Dr. Ajiboye said. He compared to the field to the computer industry in 1980 when it was on track for a revolution.

“I firmly believe that we’re at the same initial ramp curve in terms of understanding brain mechanisms,” he said.

During the Neuralink presentation, a video showed a monkey named Pager reportedly using a prototype implant in its brain to move a cursor across a computer screen. Mr. Musk’s team also showed off the inner workings of the device, impressing some of the neuroscientists who watched the event.

During the event, Mr. Musk announced that Neuralink was seeking permission from the Food and Drug Administration to test the device in humans, and he guessed that a clinical trial would begin next year.

This would be a notable step forward for the field. Others have tested wireless devices in humans, but Neuralink is investing so heavily in the project that it may come forward quickly with a more powerful device than before.

“They basically sourced a lot of the best ideas out there in the top of the field and paid to bring them together into a new system. And I think that is exciting,” said Cristin Welle, a University of Colorado neuroscientist and former F.D.A. brain-implant lab director and device consultant. “Now whether they can really surmount all of these technical hurdles to demonstrate that it is in fact safe, it remains to be seen.”

It is the F.D.A. that will decide when the trial begins if it grants approval to Neuralink. The agency will pay close attention to device durability, given the risks and feasibility of repeated brain surgeries, Dr. Welle said. That means device makers will have to surmount the challenge of operating electronics for years in the soggy milieu of the brain. They will also need to prove that their supercomputing device does not generate heat or current that unduly injures the delicate brain tissue, she said. There are also very real limits to what the device can do. There may be ethical limits too.

As Neuralink pursues a human trial, it is fighting complaints over its tests with monkeys. The company filed papers in a California court this month seeking to block the release of photos of primates it tested from 2017 through 2020. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group, previously obtained hundreds of pages of veterinary records and filed a complaint with the Agriculture Department, claiming primate test subjects developed infections and were treated carelessly.

The Agriculture Department said it could not comment on the group’s complaint, citing the pending litigation. Neuralink has denied the claims, but they could affect the progress of its technology.

If and when Neuralink begins a human trial, it would be limited to people who have real needs for the technology, most likely those with spinal cord injuries or other forms of paralysis.

Although Mr. Musk has said the Neuralink device could be implanted in healthy humans to enhance their abilities, that seems a remote possibility at this stage. He has compared future uses of the implant to those of another medical device that is marketed for reasons that are not purely disease-curing: Lasik surgery lasers, which are used to improve vision.

“There is an ethics question that needs to be answered, and they have yet to address it,” Dr. Ajiboye said, referring to Mr. Musk and Neuralink.

To Mr. Beggin, implanting such a device in a completely healthy person is a step too far. He would prefer that Mr. Musk and his company focus on people like him who could use this device to restore functions that have been taken away, like shaking someone’s hand or waving to a curious child who approaches his wheelchair.

“Using the technology to allow an able-bodied person to start a car?” he said. “It is a hard thing for me to rationalize.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/health/elon-musk-brain-implants-paralysis.html
0;Supreme Court Refuses to Block California’s Ban on Flavored Tobacco;"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to block a California law banning flavored tobacco, clearing the way for the ban to take effect next week.

As is the court’s practice when it rules on emergency applications, its brief order gave no reasons. There were no noted dissents.

R.J. Reynolds, the maker of Newport menthol cigarettes, had asked the justices to intervene before next Wednesday, when the law is set to go into effect. The company, joined by several smaller ones, argued that a federal law, the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, allows states to regulate tobacco products but prohibits banning them.

“They can raise the minimum purchase age, restrict sales to particular times and locations, and enforce licensing regimes,” lawyers for Reynolds and several smaller companies wrote in an emergency application. “But one thing they cannot do is completely prohibit the sale of those products for failing to meet the state’s or locality’s preferred tobacco product standards.”

State officials responded that the federal law was meant to preserve the longstanding power of state and local authorities to regulate tobacco products and to ban their sale. Before and after the enactment of the federal law, they wrote, state and local authorities have taken action against flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes. Whether the federal law displaces the state law turns on the interpretation of interlocking and overlapping statutory language in the federal law. The state officials told the justices that “courts have universally rejected the tobacco industry’s arguments that state and local laws restricting or prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco products are expressly pre-empted by that act.”

They added: “Indeed, in the 13 years since Congress enacted” the 2009 law, “no court has agreed with the tobacco industry position that the act pre-empts restrictions and prohibitions on the sale of flavored tobacco products.”

Reynolds also lost on that issue in March in a case concerning a Los Angeles County ordinance similar to the state law. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that the 2009 law did not displace the ordinance. Reynolds has asked the Supreme Court to hear that case.

A federal judge considering the company’s separate challenge to the state law ruled in November that she was bound by that precedent and refused to block the law.

The law had been set to go into effect early last year, but it was suspended while voters considered a referendum challenging it. The tobacco industry spent tens of millions of dollars in support of the measure, but 63 percent of the state’s voters approved the law in November.

In their Supreme Court brief, state officials urged the justices not to delay the law any longer. “The unsuccessful referendum campaign has already delayed the implementation” of the law for nearly two years, they wrote, “allowing children and teenagers across the state to be initiated into the deadly habit of tobacco use via flavored tobacco products throughout that period.”

The plaintiffs told the justices that they face “substantial financial losses” from the law, noting that menthol cigarettes make up about a third of the cigarette market.

Allowing a ban on menthol cigarettes, lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote, “could also cause significant negative consequences for communities of color, including African Americans. Because African American smokers in particular disproportionately prefer menthol cigarettes, California’s ban would disproportionately harm them, including by exposing them to negative encounters with law enforcement.” The argument rankled Valerie Yerger, a University of California, San Francisco, health policy researcher and founding member of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council.

“When we look at the need to protect African Americans from the predatory exploitation of the tobacco industry, we need to look at the fact that a menthol ban will protect them,” Ms. Yerger said. “It will not only add years to people’s lives, but it will increase the quality of their life.”

State officials pointed the justices to a letter in April from the N.A.A.C.P. to the Food and Drug Administration lamenting what the group called the “egregious marketing practices of the tobacco industry” and the fact that “African Americans suffer disproportionately from being addicted to cigarettes and the effects of long-term tobacco use.”

Last week, the Justice Department announced an agreement for 200,000 retailers to display eye-catching signs in their stores about the dangers of cigarette smoking. The order goes into effect in July and gives retailers three months to post the signs. The agreement settles the terms of a 1999 racketeering lawsuit filed by the U.S. government against tobacco companies, including Reynolds.

Also last week, a federal court judge in Texas sided with tobacco companies, blocking an F.D.A. order to place large graphic warnings about the harms of cigarettes on individual packages.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/us/supreme-court-flavored-tobacco-ban-california.html
0;Where the Skinny Jeans Are;"LOS ANGELES — The wheatpaste posters and bus stop ads started popping up across the city in early December. They featured a woman, head thrown back in ecstasy and hair frozen in midair, along with the words: Celine at The Wiltern.

The Wiltern theater, a neon-lit Art Deco gem in Los Angeles’s Koreatown neighborhood, opened as a cinema in 1931. Originally designed for vaudeville performances, the venue over the years has hosted live events by such musical acts as Prince, Bob Dylan and Beck. Last Thursday it continued in that tradition, hosting a fashion show and concert with a lineup so stacked it might have made Coachella bookers see green.

First up was Iggy Pop, croaking in his signature style, prancing shirtless and writhing and thrashing on the ground. Next came The Strokes, whose set of hits from their turn-of-the-century albums like “Is This It” and “Room on Fire” led so many revelers to rush the stage that the performance was forced to end early. Interpol then played briefly. The festivities ran so late — well past 1 a.m. — that the show’s final act, a D.J. set by The Kills, didn’t happen at all.

The performers were all booked by Celine, the French label owned by the Louis Vuitton Mo?t Hennessy luxury goods group, and now overseen by top designer Hedi Slimane. For nearly three decades, Mr. Slimane’s work — at Dior Homme, Saint Laurent and Celine — has had a symbiotic relationship with music, particularly rock ’n’ roll. That relationship was not only on display during the concert but also the runway show that preceded it, which presented Celine’s fall 2023 women’s wear collection. Set to a loop of “Hello Operator” by The White Stripes, the show featured pin-thin models parading in skinny jeans tucked into leather boots (some fringed), slinky tops, scarves tied loosely around their necks, suit vests, military-inspired jackets and a series of glamorous dresses. Some of the dresses were languorously cut; others were short, frisky and worn beneath shearling coats.

Seats on the theater’s main floor and in its upper mezzanine were filled with celebrities (Doja Cat, Wiz Khalifa, Brie Larson, Miles Teller, Dustin Hoffman, Priscilla Presley, Paris Hilton), stylists, fashion editors and hundreds of other people that Celine described as “friends of the house.” Attendees wore lanky suits, glittering dresses, bodysuits and enough motorcycle jackets that a reporter was surprised not to see a single motorcycle parked out front.

“I think music is his muse,” Kim Gordon, singer and bassist of the band Sonic Youth, said of Mr. Slimane, whom she first met at the Cannes Film Festival. Ms. Gordon, who is now a visual artist, was later photographed by Mr. Slimane when he helmed Saint Laurent as part of a campaign for the brand. “I mean, he really loves skinny rock dudes,” she added.

“I’d say it’s giving indie sleaze,” the stylist Mel Ottenberg said of the fashion show, using a term popularized by the trend forecaster Mandy Lee to describe a time in the early 2000s when “basics” meant clothes from American Apparel, and when Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were known more for partying at the Jane Hotel than for running The Row. “While I was a little horrified by the skintight pants, I trust him,” Mr. Ottenberg, the editor in chief of Interview magazine, added of Mr. Slimane. “If he’s saying they’re coming back, I believe him.” Lizzy Goodman, a writer and contributor to The New York Times whose book chronicling New York’s 2000s indie rock scene, “Meet Me in the Bathroom,” was the basis for a recent documentary, said that Mr. Slimane’s relationship with the fashion of that era “is really foundational.” The day of the Celine show, the brand distributed a slim black book to the press titled “Age of Indieness,” which contained a conversation between Ms. Goodman and Mr. Slimane about the way fashion, music and subcultures all shape the image of a particular moment in time.

“What pulls him, I think, to rock ’n’ roll over and over again is the idea of an eternal aliveness that is always ending as it’s beginning,” Ms. Goodman added of Mr. Slimane, who rarely gives interviews and declined to comment for this article.

But music was not the collection’s only perceptible influence. Some guests said the clothes on the runway were clearly inspired by Los Angeles, the city in which they were shown, where Mr. Slimane previously lived and worked for several years.  “Look, there’s the cool French girl thing, and obviously Hedi gets that and does that,” the model Cindy Crawford said. “But he knows the essence of what makes the cool L.A. girl.”

Ms. Crawford, who wore a sparkly T-shirt dress, was there in part to cheer on her daughter, Kaia Gerber, who walked in the show. “He knows the essence of a place,” Ms. Crawford added of Mr. Slimane. “When I walked up, everyone was smoking! It was like Paris in L.A.”

Mr. Ottenberg, the Interview editor, said that, “Hedi is always really, really, L.A.” But the red-carpet-worthy dresses that closed the show “felt particularly L.A.,” he added. “There’s a lot of lame gowns out there and I thought these were pretty perfect.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/style/los-angeles-celine-2023-runway.html
0;FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Is Arrested in the Bahamas;"Follow our live coverage of the arrest of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges.

“S.B.F.’s arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against S.B.F. and is likely to request his extradition,” the government of the Bahamas said in a statement.

The arrest was the latest stunning development in one of the most dramatic falls from grace in recent corporate history. Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, was scheduled to testify in Congress on Tuesday about the collapse of FTX, which was one of the most powerful firms in the emerging crypto industry until it imploded virtually overnight last month after a run on deposits exposed an $8 billion hole in its accounts.

Prosecutors for the Southern District of New York confirmed that Mr. Bankman-Fried had been charged and said an indictment would be unsealed on Tuesday. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement that it had authorized charges “relating to Mr. Bankman-Fried’s violations of our securities laws.”

The criminal charges against Mr. Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering, said a person with knowledge of the matter.

Mr. Bankman-Fried, who was the only person charged in the indictment, was taken into custody by the Bahamian authorities, the person said. He was arrested shortly after 6 p.m. at his apartment complex in the Albany resort in the Bahamas, according to a statement from the Bahamian police. The timing of when Mr. Bankman-Fried might be moved to the United States was unclear. While the Bahamas has an extradition treaty with the United States, the process can take weeks, and sometimes far longer if a criminal defendant contests it.

Mr. Bankman-Fried was cooperative during the arrest, according to a person familiar with the matter, and will be held overnight in a cell at a police station. He is scheduled to appear on Tuesday in Magistrate Court in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas.

A spokesman for Mr. Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, also declined to comment. “Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. government, based on a sealed indictment,” Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.”

Once a golden boy of the crypto industry and a major donor to the Democratic Party, Mr. Bankman-Fried has seen his vast business and political empire collapse with stunning speed. His exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, and his personal fortune has dwindled to virtually nothing. While he used to be hailed as a modern-day John Pierpont Morgan, he’s now more often likened to Bernie Madoff, who orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history.

Lawyers involved in the case expressed surprise at the suddenness of the arrest. Mr. Bankman-Fried had been widely expected to face a criminal indictment. But complex white-collar fraud cases can take months to build. Until the arrest, Mr. Bankman-Fried was slated to testify remotely about the FTX collapse in a hearing in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. The hearing is still set to go ahead, just without Mr. Bankman-Fried’s testimony.

“The American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people,” Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the committee, said in a statement. “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.”

Several people familiar with the investigation said the speed with which the authorities moved in filing criminal and civil charges was an indication that prosecutors and regulators had received information from cooperating witnesses.

Mr. Bankman-Fried has been facing scrutiny from dozens of regulators across the world, including the Justice Department, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prosecutors in Manhattan have been examining whether FTX broke the law by transferring billions in customer funds to Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund that Mr. Bankman-Fried also founded and owned.

They have also focused on whether Mr. Bankman-Fried and his hedge fund engaged in market manipulation that may have helped cause the failure of two prominent cryptocurrencies last spring.

Ever since FTX collapsed, the S.E.C. and federal prosecutors have moved quickly with requests for documents from various parties, including some of the big financial firms that invested up to $2 billion in the crypto exchange beginning last year, said two people briefed on the matter.

It is unclear whether the federal authorities are looking at charging anyone else in connection with the collapse of FTX. It is not uncommon for an S.E.C. civil complaint to reveal more information about the events that led to the filing of charges than an indictment.

FTX’s collapse began early last month, when a run on deposits revealed an $8 billion hole in the company’s finances. Mr. Bankman-Fried sought a lifeline from a rival company, the giant crypto exchange Binance, but the deal fell through after Binance examined FTX’s books.

Mr. Bankman-Fried quickly became a villain in the crypto industry. Hundreds of thousands of customers have funds trapped on FTX, with little prospect of getting them back anytime soon.

Surprisingly for an executive facing criminal investigations, Mr. Bankman-Fried had given numerous media interviews in the wake of FTX’s collapse. At the recent DealBook Summit, a New York Times event, he blamed “huge management failures” and sloppy accounting for his company’s implosion, insisting that he “did not ever try to commit fraud” or knowingly dip into the funds of FTX customers to finance other investments.

When FTX filed for bankruptcy, Mr. Bankman-Fried stepped down as chief executive. He was replaced by John Ray, a seasoned corporate turnaround expert who oversaw the unwinding of the energy trading company Enron after an accounting scandal in 2001.

In a bankruptcy filing last month, Mr. Ray said that the management of FTX reflected a “complete failure of corporate control.”

Mr. Ray was also scheduled to testify to the House on Tuesday. In a prepared statement, he said FTX had been a mess.

The collapse stemmed “from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals,” he wrote.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html
0;United Airlines Orders 100 Wide-Body Boeing 787 Jets;"United Airlines plans to buy at least 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets by 2032 as it replaces aging planes with newer, more fuel-efficient models and pursues international growth, the airline announced on Tuesday.

The order, worth tens of billions of dollars at list prices, comes a little more than a year after United said it planned to buy 270 single-aisle planes — the largest purchase of U.S. aircraft in a decade. The airline added a few dozen jets to that order on Tuesday and said it now expected to receive 700 new planes in all by the end of 2032, including an average of two planes per week next year and three planes per week in 2024.

In addition to its firm order for 100 Dreamliners, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2024, United has the option to buy 100 more.

The airline’s decision is important for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the twin-aisle Dreamliner after a more than yearlong delay because of quality concerns, including filling paper-thin gaps in the plane’s body. Boeing has also been hindered by supply chain disruptions, inflation and other economic challenges.

United said it chose Boeing over the rival plane maker Airbus because the airline is eager to grow and already has several dozen 787s as well as the pilots trained to fly them. The airline still has an order on the books to receive dozens of Airbus A350s, a 787 competitor, in 2030.

“They’re both great airplanes,” United’s chief executive, Scott Kirby, said on a call with reporters. “But we already have a large installed base of 787s. And in this world where we’re trying to bring on 2,500 pilots a year and grow the airline, introducing a new fleet type slows that down dramatically.”

Single-aisle, or narrow-body, planes are typically used for flights within the United States or to nearby international destinations. The larger twin-aisle, or wide-body, planes best serve heavily trafficked or long-distance routes. The narrow-body 737 Max can carry 170 to 230 passengers, depending on the configuration. The wide-body 787 Dreamliner can carry about 250 to more than 330 passengers.

New planes provide many benefits. They can offer an improved customer experience, with cleaner, more streamlined and sometimes more spacious interiors. (United said the 787 is a customer favorite among the aircraft in its fleet.) They can also save airlines money because their designs are more fuel efficient and require less maintenance.

That is the case for the order announced Tuesday. United said it planned to drop 100 Boeing 767 and 777 wide-body planes from its fleet by 2030, resulting in what it said would be a 25 percent decrease in carbon emissions per seat.

“The Boeing team is honored by United’s trust in our family of airplanes to connect people and transport cargo around the world for decades to come,” said Stanley A. Deal, president and chief executive of Boeing’s commercial plane unit.

In the past two years, United has added more than a dozen new international cities to its network. The airline said it now serves 78 international destinations out of Newark Liberty International Airport, more than at any of its other hub airports.

The airline industry was among the first and hardest-hit by the pandemic, with air travel plummeting more than 95 percent in the spring of 2020. Travel has since recovered, led by domestic trips for which narrow-body planes are particularly well suited. Airlines have started to place big aircraft orders to take advantage of that demand and longer-term growth.

In addition to United’s order, Southwest Airlines last year announced plans to buy 100 Boeing 737 Max planes. Delta Air Lines this summer said it planned to buy 100 Max planes, too. In October, Alaska Airlines, the fifth-largest passenger airline in the United States, announced plans to buy 52 Max jets.

United said its order would result in more jobs, too. This year, the airline has hired 15,000 new employees, including flight attendants, maintenance workers, pilots and others. United said it planned to hire a similar number next year, with more than 2,000 new jobs at each of its hub airports in Chicago, San Francisco and Newark.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/business/united-airlines-boeing.html
0;The slowdown in inflation was driven by food, energy and used vehicles.;"A rise in food prices, which had been propelling rapid inflation for more than a year, appears to be cooling off. Although food overall is 10.6 percent more expensive than it was at this time last year, items like meat dropped in price over the past month, and food served at restaurants rose less quickly than it has over the past quarter.

Energy prices continued to fall in November, partially as a result of the Covid-related lockdowns in China, which decreased demand. (Those lockdowns have recently been eased.) The cost of gas used to heat homes fell for the second straight month, while fuel oil — which is more prevalent in New England — continued to rise slightly, and is up 65.7 percent over the year.

Critically for the Federal Reserve, core inflation — which strips out volatile food and energy — is decelerating, to 6 percent over the year. That’s an indication that price increases are slowing broadly.

The original item to skyrocket in price, used cars, is definitively rolling over as auto manufacturing has ramped up and strained consumers begin to push back. Prices in the new car market stalled out, but have yet to fall.

The cost of rent continues to drive overall inflation, though the Labor Department’s measure is backward-looking; more current indicators have shown new leases dropping sharply in some markets.

Owners’ equivalent rent, which tracks elements such as insurance, mortgage interest and overall home prices, has decelerated only slightly in recent months despite rapidly rising interest rates.

Prices for medical care services, which had been accelerating as patients started to come back for their normal procedures after the pandemic, dropped for the second month in a row.

Flight fares continued to fall going into the holidays as airlines managed to add planes and fuel prices eased.

And if you’re out holiday shopping, books and toys would be good options, as they’ve both been dropping in price for several months (but remain solidly above 2019 levels).

0;Major Fusion Energy Breakthrough to Be Announced by Scientists;"Scientists at a federal nuclear weapons facility have made a potentially significant advance in fusion research that could lead to a source of bountiful energy in the future, according to a government official.

The advance is expected to be announced Tuesday by the Department of Energy, which said a “major scientific breakthrough” was made at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Jennifer Granholm, the energy secretary, and White House and other Energy Department officials are expected to be in attendance. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that the scientific advance involves the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, which uses giant lasers to create conditions that briefly mimic the explosions of nuclear weapons.

The government official, who spoke anonymously to discuss results that are not yet public, said that the fusion experiment at NIF achieved what is known as ignition, where the fusion energy generated equals the laser energy that started the reaction. Ignition is also called energy gain of one.

A scientist familiar with the results who spoke anonymously for the same reason also confirmed that NIF has achieved ignition.

Such a development would improve the ability of the United States to maintain its nuclear weapons without nuclear testing and could set the stage for future progress that could one day lead to the use of laser fusion as a source of carbon-free energy.

Although not yet publicly announced, the news has quickly bounced among physicists and other scientists who study fusion.

“Yesterday a scientist friend sent me a note stating that Livermore had exceeded energy gain of one just last week and would be announcing the result on Tuesday,” Stephen Bodner, a retired plasma physicist who has long been a critic of NIF, said in an email Monday morning. “They deserve commendations for reaching their goal.”

What is fusion?
Fusion is the thermonuclear reaction that powers the sun and other stars — the fusing of hydrogen atoms into helium. The mass of helium is slightly less than the original hydrogen atoms. Thus, by Einstein’s iconic E=mc? equation, that difference in mass is converted into a burst of energy.

Fusion that could be produced in a controlled fashion on Earth could mean an energy source that does not produce greenhouse gases like coal and oil, or dangerous, long-lived radioactive waste, as current nuclear power plants do.

How do you produce fusion without a star?
Most fusion efforts to date have employed doughnut-shaped reactors known as tokamaks. Within the reactors, hydrogen gas is heated to temperatures hot enough that the electrons are stripped away from the hydrogen nuclei, creating what is known as a plasma — clouds of positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons. Magnetic fields trap the plasma within the doughnut shape, and the nuclei fuse together, releasing energy in the form of neutrons flying outward.

Tuesday’s announcement, however, involves a different approach. NIF consists of 192 gigantic lasers, which fire simultaneously at a metal cylinder about the size of a pencil eraser. The cylinder, heated to some 5.4 million degrees Fahrenheit, vaporizes, generating an implosion of X-rays, which in turn heats and compresses a BB-size pellet of frozen deuterium and tritium, two heavier forms of hydrogen. The implosion fuses the hydrogen into helium, creating fusion. What laser fusion advances have been made so far?
The main purpose of NIF, built at a cost of $3.5 billion, is to conduct experiments that help the United States maintain its nuclear weapons without nuclear test explosions. Proponents also said it could advance fusion research that could lead to viable commercial power plants.

However, NIF initially generated hardly any fusion at all. In 2014, Livermore scientists finally reported success, but the energy produced then was minuscule — the equivalent of what a 60-watt light bulb consumes in five minutes.

Last year, Livermore scientists reported a major leap, a burst of energy — 10 quadrillion watts of power — that was 70 percent as much as the energy of laser light hitting the hydrogen target.

But the burst — essentially a miniature hydrogen bomb — lasted only 100 trillionths of a second.

The report by the Financial Times on Sunday suggests Livermore will announce that in the latest experiment the fusion energy produced exceeded the amount of laser energy hitting the hydrogen target.

For that to occur, the fusion reaction had to be self-sustaining, meaning the torrent of particles flowing outward from the hot spot at the center of the pellet heated surrounding hydrogen atoms and caused them to fuse as well.

What are the obstacles to fusion power?
An important caveat is that the claim focuses on the laser energy hitting the hydrogen target. NIF’s lasers are extremely inefficient, meaning only a small fraction of the energy used to power the lasers actually makes it into the beams themselves.

More modern technology like solid-state lasers would be more efficient but still far from 100 percent fusion; for this to be practical, the fusion energy output must be at least several times greater than that of the incoming lasers.

Does Tuesday’s announcement mean we’ll have cheap fusion energy soon?
No.

Even if scientists figure out how to generate bigger bursts of fusion, immense engineering hurdles would remain.

NIF’s experiments have studied one burst at a time.

A practical fusion power plant using this concept would require a machine-gun pace of laser bursts with new hydrogen targets sliding into place for each burst. Then the torrents of neutrons flying outward from the fusion reactions would have to be converted into electricity.

The laser complex fills a building with a footprint equal to three football fields — too big, too expensive, too inefficient for a commercial power plant.

A manufacturing process to mass-produce the precise hydrogen targets would have to be developed.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/science/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough.html
0;For Max Verstappen, a Formula 1 Season Like No Other;"Max Verstappen said his season was not perfect, but it will be regarded as one of the best in Formula 1 history.

Verstappen set a record for the number of Grand Prix victories in a season with 15, surpassing the previous best of 13 by Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher to become the second-youngest driver to attain two championships.

“This season was just great,” Verstappen of Red Bull said in an interview. “We had a rough start, but after that we did very little wrong, and even though you cannot be perfect, we will always strive to achieve that.”

Verstappen did not finish in two of the first three Grands Prix because of reliability issues with his car. After that, he was nearly unstoppable as he overcame a 46-point deficit to Charles Leclerc of Ferrari to win the championship by 146 points. His total of 454 set a record for a season.

“Me, personally, I try to be a perfectionist, and I know that’s very hard, but I demand that from myself and I demand that from the team, and the team demands that from me,” he said. “We always have a very honest conversation about it. Sometimes, you disagree on things, and that’s fine. That’s how it works in life, but it’s always very important to be honest with each other, and really say when something is not correct.”

Red Bull adapted better than their rivals to the changes to the aerodynamic regulations, devised to allow the cars to follow more closely and aid overtaking, that were introduced for 2022.

“At the end of the day, it’s all about who designs the best car, who comes up with the more clever ideas,” Verstappen said.

“At the start of the season, it was all a big question mark for everyone, where you were going to be. OK, you have your own numbers, but you don’t know what others might have found. From the start, our car was just a better car compared to the competition.”  Verstappen became a two-time champion with victory at the Japanese Grand Prix in October, with four races to spare.

Two weeks later, when he won the United States Grand Prix, he helped Red Bull take its first constructors’ championship since 2014.

“You always need two cars to perform well, and this year we did,” said Verstappen, referring to his teammate Sergio P?rez. “It’s really satisfying for everyone at the factory. They work flat out trying to achieve it.  “Winning the drivers’ title is amazing, but it gives you even more satisfaction if you can win as a team as well.”

The successes were in contrast with 2021, when he passed Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes on the final lap of the last race in Abu Dhabi to become champion for the first time. Red Bull finished 28 points behind Mercedes, which won an eighth consecutive constructors’ title.

Verstappen said that his first title “was honestly the more emotional one” but that the second was “definitely the most satisfying.”

“That’s just because of what we have done this year in terms of the amount of race wins, but also just working with the team the whole season,” he said.

“Last year, we lost a lot of points battling. This year, we had a bit more luck, and in general, we were more competitive.”

Christian Horner, the team principal, said Verstappen had “made another step this year.”

“Winning last year’s championship really took the pressure off his shoulders,” he said in an interview. “He just matured and moved up a gear.

“He adapted to the new regulations brilliantly, got his head down and just drove some incredible races. When you look at those Grand Prix victories, wow, there are some incredible races there. He was absolutely the outstanding driver of the season.”

Hamilton, who finished sixth in the drivers’ championship, said Verstappen did a great job.

“He’s done everything that he had to do,” Hamilton said. “The team provided him with an amazing car, and he’s delivered pretty much every weekend.”

Horner said he did not believe that Verstappen had been given the credit he deserved over the past two years.

Comparing Vettel, who won four titles with Red Bull from 2010 to 2013, and Verstappen, he said: “Two very different drivers, two phenomenally successful drivers. What Sebastian has achieved puts him among the great and most successful drivers in the sport. But what we saw this year from Max, we witnessed something very special.

“I sometimes think his achievements don’t receive the plaudits they should because it was an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver who is very much at the top of his game.”

With Red Bull finishing 205 points ahead of Ferrari in the constructors’ championship, it has raised a question of whether Formula 1 is headed into an era of Red Bull dominance, like Mercedes did from 2014 to 2021.

“With new regulations, it’s always very important to hit it off well, and I think we did that,” Verstappen said. “Now, it’s all about trying to continue that and trying to find even more performance in the cars.

“Normally, over the years, it all comes together, the teams get a bit closer. Yes, we’ve had a good head start, but as a team, we’re never satisfied. We always want more. We want to do better, but we also depend on what the other teams find or improve on.”

Horner said it would be very difficult for Verstappen and Red Bull to dominate in 2023.

“Ferrari will make progress from this year, and, Mercedes developed their car hard,” he said.

“They brought a lot of development through the year, so they are going to make a step, and I think you will have a three-way battle next year.”

Red Bull heads into 2023 handicapped by a penalty from the F.I.A., the sport’s governing body, for breaching the cost cap for 2021.

Teams were allowed a budget of $145 million that season; Red Bull exceeded it by nearly $2 million. It was fined $7 million and hit with a 10 percent reduction in the amount of time it can spend testing the aerodynamics of its car in the wind tunnel for 12 months, which may affect next year’s car.

“Of course, it will have an effect,” Horner said. “It is constricting your development tools. It just means we will have to think smarter and be more selective in what we test and run. We just need to adapt.

“And what we have lost in wind-tunnel time, we have gained in motivation, so we have just got to get on with it, get our heads down, and do the very best job that we can.” A further shadow was cast over the team, and the relationship between Verstappen and P?rez, at the penultimate race in S?o Paulo, Brazil, in November.

In the final laps, Verstappen refused to give up a position to P?rez, who was chasing second place in the drivers’ championship, despite a team instruction to do so.

Verstappen later cited an incident between them earlier in the season as his reason. He did not elaborate on that or say why he did not move aside in Brazil. P?rez said of Verstappen over the team radio, “It shows who he really is.” P?rez finished the season in third place for the championship, three points behind Leclerc.

The drivers discussed the problem with team management after the race.

P?rez, who won Grands Prix in Monaco and Singapore, said that it had been “a hell of a year for Red Bull” and that he did not want what happened “to take any enjoyment away from any of the guys in my team.”

“Max and myself now have a very strong responsibility to keep this united team going forward,” he said.

Horner said the incident was “a blip” and “lessons were learned.”

“They are working as team members and will continue to do so,” he said. “We need to work as a team to beat our opponents again next year. They have been the most successful pairing we have ever had, and I think they will do a great job for us next year.”

Verstappen said that he had “a great relationship” with P?rez and that there would be no hangover into 2023.

“We put everything on the table and everything was solved,” he said. “I have never been a bad teammate to anyone, I’ve always been very helpful, and the team knows that. I always put the team upfront because, at the end of the day, it is a team effort.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/sports/autoracing/f1-max-verstappen.html
0;Lauren Boebert, Far-Right Firebrand, Wins Re-election After Recount;"After a recount in a remarkably close race, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, known for heckling President Biden during his State of the Union speech, arming herself on Capitol Hill and ignoring Covid mask rules, won her bid for a second term. Colorado’s secretary of state, Jena Griswold, announced the results on Monday.

Ms. Boebert, 35, staved off a fierce challenge from Adam Frisch, a Democratic businessman and former Aspen, Colo., city councilman, in the state’s Republican-leaning Third District.

Mr. Frisch, who faced a deficit of roughly 500 votes out of more than 327,000 cast, gained just two votes in the automatic recount. In the end, Ms. Boebert won with 50.06 percent of the vote, to Mr. Frisch’s 49.89 percent.

On Twitter on Sunday, before the recount was made official by the secretary of state, Ms. Boebert said: “Our conservative policies will help all Americans to overcome the challenges we face so each of us has the opportunity to live our very best life. Thank you for entrusting me to help lead the way. I’ll be working every day to prove I can get the job done right.”

Mr. Frisch had sought to cast Ms. Boebert as a flamethrower in an increasingly polarized Congress, saying she was focused more on placating the Republican Party’s far-right Trump wing than on reducing inflation and adding jobs.

He presented himself in a television ad as not a typical Democrat, saying that he would not vote for Representative Nancy Pelosi for House speaker and that he supported border security. He showed footage of himself hunting with a shotgun.

But a disadvantage in name recognition and the makeup of voters in the district proved too much for Mr. Frisch to overcome against Ms. Boebert, who has drawn national attention for her incendiary actions.

On Monday evening, he released a statement on his loss. “While we hoped for a different outcome,” Mr. Frisch said, “we defied incredible odds with the closeness of this race.” He added, “I am confident that the coalition of Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters we built throughout this campaign to reject hate and extremism in Southern and Western Colorado will grow into the future.”

Along with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a fellow Republican also in her first term, Ms. Boebert brought a no-holds-barred brand of politics to the House, feeding off a social media echo chamber of loyalists who backed former President Donald J. Trump. That has put Ms. Boebert at odds with platforms like Twitter, which temporarily suspended her account after she spread the falsehood that the 2020 election was rigged.

Her rhetoric and her style of politics also made her a target of Democrats during the Republican primary, many of whom crossed party lines to support her Republican challenger, driven by fears of her extremism.

Ms. Boebert won her seat in Congress in 2020, when she unseated a five-term incumbent in the Republican primary before going on to win the general election. Until then, she had run a gun-themed restaurant in Colorado’s ranch country — the Shooters Grill — where she encouraged staff members to carry firearms and defied restrictions by staying open during the pandemic.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/us/politics/lauren-boebert-colorado-elected.html
0;Inside the Battle for Control of the Republican National Committee;"As anger and frustration ripple through the Republican Party over its underwhelming performance in this year’s midterm elections, Republicans are offering a number of explanations for their losses.

Bad candidates. Weak fund-raising. The looming presence of Donald Trump. Election denial. The Democrats’ edge in the mechanics of running campaigns. Strategic and tactical errors by Republican leaders. Too much cultural red meat and not enough serious answers to the economic concerns of ordinary Americans.

Some in the Trump wing of the party have settled on their own scapegoat: Ronna McDaniel, who has been the chair of the Republican National Committee since 2017. Coming after McDaniel reshaped the committee in the former president’s image — it was even paying his considerable legal bills until recently — this discontent is a striking turn of events.

The committee’s 168 members from across the country will vote on McDaniel’s re-election in January. And the race has heated up over the last two weeks.

She has already deterred one challenge from Representative Lee Zeldin, this year’s Republican nominee for governor of New York, who briefly explored a run — but pulled back days later after finding only a few dozen potential supporters within the committee.

While McDaniel appears to have shored up her internal position, she is also contending with a hunger for change from outside the party’s formal structures. And the one person who might be able to secure her standing — Trump — has told aides that he is staying out of the race.

Roughly two-thirds of committee members are already backing McDaniel, according to a letter circulated by her allies.

The letter praises McDaniel’s investments in state parties, community centers and “election integrity units”; her decision to cut ties with the Committee on Presidential Debates, which hosts those much-anticipated events every four years; and her “ongoing investments in data, digital, and in a permanent ground game in key locations around the country.” McDaniel’s allies also credit her with raising $1.5 billion as party chair, including $325 million for the 2022 midterms, and for making gains in party registration in Arizona, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

The race for R.N.C. chair is just one window into the Republican Party’s post-midterm demolition derby — with governors and senators leading an increasingly vocal anti-Trump chorus — but a revealing one. It’s proving especially useful for those who would prefer to change the subject from Trump, whose third presidential run has landed in the party with a mixture of trepidation and condemnation.

0;Project Veritas Says It Provided $20,500 in ‘Excess Benefit’ to Its Founder;"WASHINGTON — Project Veritas, the right-wing group known for its sting operations, reported in its latest filing to the I.R.S. that it provided a prohibited “excess benefit” last year to its founder, James O’Keefe.

Every year, the I.R.S. asks nonprofits to report if their executives received undue or excessive benefits. In its 2021 filings with federal and state regulators, Project Veritas said yes, reporting $20,512 in excess benefits to Mr. O’Keefe.

In those tax filings, submitted in November and posted online by charity regulators in Hawaii, Project Veritas did not describe the benefits.

On Monday, the executive director of Project Veritas, Daniel Strack, said the spending related to Project Veritas staff who accompanied Mr. O’Keefe when he starred in an outdoor production of “Oklahoma!” staged at a farm in Roseland, Va.

“The disclosure on our 990 pertains to Project Veritas staff helping film behind the scenes and staff who were on site to accommodate James,” Mr. Strack wrote in a statement issued through a spokesman, referring to the filing with the I.R.S.

As a result, the group said, Mr. O’Keefe had incurred a tax equal to 25 percent of the excess benefit, or $5,128. Mr. Strack, through the spokesman, said the tax “has been paid.”

Tax law also requires that nonprofit executives who receive excess benefits “correct” them by repaying the value of those benefits, or face a tax penalty worth double that amount.

In its filings, Project Veritas said Mr. O’Keefe had not repaid the excess benefits as of the end of 2021. On Monday, a spokesman for the group said Mr. O’Keefe had repaid the money this year.

Marcus Owens, a lawyer who headed the I.R.S. division overseeing nonprofits, said it was unusual for nonprofits to report an excess benefit transaction but say it had not been corrected in the same year. Mr. Owens said that might invite further scrutiny from the I.R.S.

Project Veritas, based in the New York suburbs, regularly carries out undercover stings, surveillance operations and ambush interviews, mostly against liberal groups and journalists.

The group grew quickly as Donald J. Trump — an ally and past donor, through Mr. Trump’s own nonprofit — came to dominate Republican politics. Between 2014 and 2021, Project Veritas’s revenue grew to $20.7 million, from $2.4 million, tax filings show.

But the latest filing shows that, in 2021, the group’s expenses also grew rapidly, to $20.6 million.

Mr. O’Keefe’s compensation fell slightly, to $405,000. But there was a significant increase in the group’s legal fees, to $4.7 million.

Project Veritas has been embroiled in several long-running legal battles. Before the presidential election, the group bought a stolen diary belonging to President Biden’s daughter, Ashley, but never published its contents.

Earlier this year, a pair of Florida residents involved in the scheme pleaded guilty to the theft of the diary and other items belonging to Ms. Biden. As part of that federal investigation, F.B.I. agents conducted a court-authorized search of Mr. O’Keefe’s home and seized his electronic devices.

Prosecutors have directly tied Project Veritas to the theft of Ms. Biden’s items in the court papers, indicating an employee for the group had directed the defendants to steal additional items to authenticate the diary and paid them additional money after receiving them.

Mr. O’Keefe recently hired two high-profile defense lawyers — Jeffrey Lichtman and Marc Fernich — to represent him in the matter.

In August, Project Veritas was ordered to pay Stanford University about $150,000 in legal fees after a federal judge tossed a defamation lawsuit a group filed in 2021. And the following month, a D.C. jury found that the conservative group violated wiretapping laws and fraudulently misrepresented itself to a Democratic consulting firm. Project Veritas was ordered to pay $120,000 but has appealed the decision.

0;2022 Review: How Republicans Lost Despite Winning the Popular Vote;"Here’s a figure about the 2022 midterm elections that might surprise you: Republicans won the national House popular vote by three percentage points — 51 percent to 48 percent. They still won by two points after adjusting for races in which only one major party was on the ballot.

Yes, that’s right: Republicans won the popular vote by a clear if modest margin, even as Democrats gained seats in the Senate and came within thousands of votes of holding the House.

If you’re looking to make sense of the 2022 election, the Republican lead in the national vote might just be the missing piece that helps fit a few odd puzzle pieces together.

The national polls, which showed growing Republican strength over the last month of the campaign, were dead-on. On paper, this ought to have meant a good — if not necessarily great — Republican election year.

Imagine, for instance, if the Republicans had run seven points better than Joe Biden’s 2020 showing in every state and district, as they did nationwide. They would have picked up 21 seats in the House, about the number many analysts expected. They also would have easily won the Senate, flipping Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and holding Pennsylvania.

Yet for a variety of reasons, Republicans failed to translate their strength into anything like a clear victory.

Real Republican strength
The Republican win in the national House popular vote is not illusion. It is not a result of uncontested races. It is not the result of lopsided turnout, like Californians staying home while Texans showed up to vote. The Republicans would still lead even if every county or state made up the same share of the electorate that it did in 2020.

It is not just about one or two Republican shining successes, like Florida or New York, either. Republicans outran Donald J. Trump’s 2020 showing in nearly every state. The exceptions are all very small states with one or two districts, where individual races can be unrepresentative of the broader national picture.

The Surprising Health Benefits of Bird-Watching
Under a lot of circumstances, this Republican showing would be impressive. Consider, for instance, that Republican candidates won the most votes for U.S. House in all four of the crucial Senate states where Republicans fell short: Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. Or, put differently: Republicans would have won the Senate, and fairly decisively, if only the likes of Dr. Mehmet Oz or Herschel Walker had fared as well as Republican House candidates on the same ballot. Republicans also won the most votes in Wisconsin, another state President Biden won in 2020. If this were a presidential election, House Republicans would have claimed 297 electoral votes. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything for 2024; it’s just another illustration that equivalent Republican strength could have looked quite impressive under slightly different circumstances.

Although the data is still fragmentary, it is clear that the Republican popular vote win was backed by a fairly sizable turnout advantage. These figures are all generally consistent with a decent Republican year, like the one evident in the state and national House popular vote.

It just didn’t show up on the scoreboard.

Republican robustness in the wrong places
If you look at the states where Republicans performed best in the House popular vote, there’s a pattern: With the exception of New York, almost all of them are in the South.

To the extent there was a so-called red wave this cycle, it largely sloshed into a relatively uninhabited area. Outside of New York, there was only one competitive House district in any of the states where Republicans outperformed Mr. Trump by at least nine points — the kind of margin that might feel like a wave. None of these states had a competitive Senate race.

Meanwhile, Democrats posted many of their best showings across the Northern tier, including much of New England, the Upper Midwest and the Northwest along with much of the interior West.  This is a recurring geographic pattern in American demographics and politics. While it shows up over and over again in American history, nowadays it roughly parallels where Mr. Trump fared well in the 2016 primaries and where he’d be likeliest to fare well again in 2024. Conversely, it also tracks with where we might expect relatively little support for abortion rights.

This state-level pattern also roughly parallels the geographic distribution of Black and Hispanic voters, who tend to be concentrated across the South and Southwest. Indeed, Republicans overperformed across the country in districts with large Black and Hispanic populations.

If we looked at two hypothetical kinds of districts — one all nonwhite, one all white — Republicans’ net gains would have been six points better in the nonwhite ones than in the white ones when compared with 2020 performance, after accounting for state and incumbency.

Black and Hispanic turnout also appeared to be much weaker than white turnout. Overall, turnout stayed near 80 percent of 2020 levels in more white areas but fell to around 50 percent of 2020 levels in areas where Black or Hispanic voters made up nearly all of the population.

There’s an outside chance that weakness among Black and Latino voters cost Democrats the House, given how close it was. Narrow losses by Democrats in some relatively diverse districts — like Arizona’s Sixth and First; California’s 13th and 22nd; and Virginia’s Second — might have been averted if their turnout and support among nonwhite voters had held up as well as it did among whites.

But on balance, the Democratic weakness among Black and Hispanic voters this cycle did more to hurt their victory margins than to cost them House and Senate races. Nonwhite voters are concentrated in relatively noncompetitive, urban districts; conversely, white voters represent an above-average share of the electorate in most of the key House races. Republicans happened to lose the Senate seats in some diverse states — Nevada, Arizona and Georgia — despite the relatively high turnout among whites.

Overall, the Republican lead in the national vote would fall to just under a point if every district represented the same share of the vote that it did two years ago. It would probably shrink even further if nonwhite voters, within each district, represented the same share of the electorate that they did in 2020.

Candidate quality
The red wave, to the extent it existed, may have come ashore in a relatively uninhabited area, but the red tide was still high enough to turn the House vote red in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, even while the Democrats won the crucial Senate seats.

How did the Democrats survive? Perhaps the simplest explanation: On average, they had better candidates thanks partly, but not completely, to weak Republican nominees.

The “MAGA” Republicans — as characterized by The Cook Political Report, based on their backing from Mr. Trump in the primaries — ran far behind the mainstream Republicans. This alone does a lot to explain the Republican showing in key Senate races in which Mr. Walker, Dr. Oz, J.D. Vance and Blake Masters underperformed or lost. But as tempting as it might be to assume that “bad Republican” nominees are mainly to blame, strong Democratic candidates probably made a difference, too.

Nationwide, Democratic incumbents enjoyed a modest incumbency advantage of a few percentage points — enough to stay standing in a red tide, even if they might have been submerged in a red wave. Almost by definition, incumbents are relatively good candidates (the bad candidates are less likely to become incumbents, after all), and they often enjoy additional advantages in fund-raising and name recognition.  Similarly, there were not many races where Democrats nominated progressives who might have alienated swing voters. Overall, progressive candidates — as defined again by The Cook Political Report’s primary score card — fared about a point worse than more typical Democrats. But there are few races where moderate Democrats can even really argue that progressive nominees cost them victory.

Still some mysteries
All of this adds up to a fairly tidy explanation, but there are a few loose ends that give me pause about whether we’ve given enough credit to the Democrats.

Perhaps the most interesting cases are the House races where no Democrat was running for re-election and Republicans nominated mainstream candidates, like in Colorado’s Eighth and Pennsylvania’s 17th. Democrats often fared quite well in races like these, even though there wasn’t a MAGA Republican or a stalwart Democrat.

What’s the excuse for the Republicans there?

This was part of a broader pattern of Democratic strength in the battleground districts, especially in traditional battleground states. Yes, there were disappointing showings for them on both coasts, but there were very few outright poor showings — ones that look like a Republican +2 environment — in the competitive House districts in the key presidential or Senate battleground states.

Maybe Democratic strength in the battlegrounds can be attributed to good campaigns, with strong advertisements and fund-raising. Or maybe I could tell a story about how demographics, abortion and democracy help explain the pattern. But while threats to democracy and abortion rights were certainly more relevant in many battleground states than in the blue states, it is not a perfect pattern. It doesn’t make sense of Colorado, for instance.

Of course, national patterns will never perfectly explain every race. But there are enough examples like these to raise a basic question about the 2022 election: Should it be understood as an outright good Democratic year that was interrupted by a few isolated Republican waves (Florida, New York, Oregon) and obscured by low nonwhite turnout in solidly Democratic areas? Or was it a good but not great Republican year that the party didn’t translate into seats because of bad candidates and somewhat inefficiently distributed strength?

The national and state House popular votes lead me to adopt the “decent Republican year” frame. But there are just enough examples of unexplained Democratic resilience that I wouldn’t be too put off if someone preferred the framing the other way.";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/upshot/2022-republicans-midterms-analysis.html
0;Biden Signs Bill to Protect Same-Sex Marriage Rights;"WASHINGTON — President Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law on Tuesday, mandating federal recognition for same-sex marriages and capping his own personal evolution toward embracing gay rights over the course of a four-decade political career.

In an elaborate signing ceremony on the South Lawn, complete with musical performances from Cyndi Lauper and Sam Smith, Mr. Biden told thousands of supporters and lawmakers that the new law represents a rare moment of bipartisanship when Democrats and Republicans came together.

“My fellow Americans, the road to this moment has been long, but those who believe in equality and justice, you never gave up,” Mr. Biden told the crowd before signing the bill into law to loud cheers and applause. He added: “We got it done. We’re going to continue the work ahead. I promise you.”

The landmark legislation, passed by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, officially erases the Defense of Marriage Act, which a quarter of a century ago formally defined marriage as between a man and a woman. The new law prohibits states from denying the validity of out-of-state marriages based on sex, race or ethnicity.

The gathering on the crisp, December afternoon, with the White House as a backdrop, was especially significant for Democratic lawmakers, for whom it could be the last major bill signing of their tenure given that Republican control of the House begins next month.

For Mr. Biden, who voted for the Defense of Marriage Act as a senator in 1996 and wavered on letting gay men and lesbians serve in the military, the signing ceremony was an indication of how much the president has changed when it comes to championing L.G.B.T.Q. equality.

It is also another example of how Mr. Biden’s gradual transformation as a politician more broadly has matched the evolution of his own party since he started in public life as a junior senator on Jan. 3, 1973.

His views on issues like abortion, gay marriage and sentencing reform — which once put him on the more conservative side of his party’s ideological spectrum — now more firmly match positions that have galvanized Democrats and even many Republicans over the past several years.

The country continues to have deep ideological fissures. But in some areas, there are now new and different majorities expressing support for societal and political norms that were far different a generation ago, shifting over time much as the president has.

In many ways, his arc is the country’s arc.

Mr. Biden, 80, was raised in a time when much of the country was less tolerant of people’s sexual orientations. His policy choices in the Senate reflected those times, often siding with those who proposed restrictions, or limits, on gay men and lesbians. He supported a measure that restricted how homosexuality was taught in schools, one of many defeats for the equality movement.

During his 2008 vice-presidential debate with Sarah Palin, Mr. Biden said he opposed “redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage.” But people close to Mr. Biden said he kept an open mind about the issue and was a keen observer of the ways that society was changing around him — and slowly changed his positions.

“I do respect and appreciate that he is someone that can admit that his views were outdated in the past and that he has evolved on the subject and is now an outspoken champion and advocate,” said Kelley Robinson, the president of Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization in Washington. “This is a matter of policy and politicians catching up to where the people already are.”

Mr. Biden also now firmly supports the rights of women to choose to have an abortion, despite having had reservations earlier in his career. A practicing Catholic, the president was once an outright critic of abortion rights but later became a quiet — if uncomfortable — defender of them in the Senate.

Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in June to end the constitutional right to an abortion, Mr. Biden has been fervent in his condemnation of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and has repeatedly called for legislation that would replace the 50-year-old court precedent with legal protections for the right of women to have an abortion.

Mr. Biden has also shifted his views on criminal sentencing, an issue that has increasingly brought Democrats and Republicans together in recent years. In 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed the First Step Act, a bipartisan compromise to reform sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.

As a young senator, Mr. Biden repeatedly supported tough-on-crime legislation, culminating in his support for the 1994 crime bill that many in his party now blame for an era of mass incarceration, especially of minorities. In a speech at the time, Mr. Biden bragged that his view of crime was to “lock the S.O.B.s up.”

That is no longer his view. As a candidate, he promised to undo provisions of the 1994 law. And as president, he has used the power of clemency to free people imprisoned for decades for minor crimes. In October, Mr. Biden issued a blanket pardon for anyone convicted of the federal crime of simple possession of marijuana. He has encouraged governors to follow suit for state marijuana laws.

But no issue represents Mr. Biden’s tendency to adapt to societal and political change as well as gay marriage. Polls show a sea change in public opinion across the political spectrum in the past decade, with nearly 70 percent of Americans now saying they support the right of same-sex couples to be married, with all the rights that heterosexual couples have under the law.

The president was unequivocal in his support for the law he signed on Tuesday, saying earlier this year that he was confident that “Republicans and Democrats can work together to secure the fundamental right of Americans to marry the person they love.”

But it is also a mark of ongoing fear that newfound gay rights may be fragile. The push for passage of the law was driven in part by the Supreme Court opinion overturning abortion rights, in which Justice Clarence Thomas raised the possibility of using the same logic to reconsider decisions protecting marriage equality and contraception rights.

Opponents of the legislation argued that it would undermine family values in the United States and restrict the religious freedoms of people who do not believe that same-sex marriage is moral.

Proponents of the new law insisted that Congress needed to be proactive in ensuring that a future Supreme Court ruling would not invalidate same-sex marriages around the country. In 2015, the court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that all states must recognize the marriages of same-sex couples just as they would marriages between a man and a woman.

Once a fiercely divisive political issue, the broad-based acceptance for same-sex marriages was the backdrop for a rare show of bipartisanship in Congress, where 61 senators and 258 House members voted to send the Respect for Marriage Act to Mr. Biden’s desk for his signature.

By the time that happened, there was no doubt that the president would sign it. As a candidate for the presidency in 2020, he was an ardent supporter of gay rights and same-sex marriage. He has appointed scores of L.G.B.T.Q. officials to posts in his administration, including Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary. Some gay rights leaders have hailed him as the most pro-equality president ever.

As vice president, Mr. Biden publicly announced his support for same-sex marriage before his boss, President Barack Obama, upending careful plans for Mr. Obama’s re-election announcement. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in 2012, Mr. Biden said that “I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying one another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights.”

It was a significant moment, especially for one of the nation’s most prominent Catholic politicians. Tuesday’s signing of the marriage bill is the latest evidence that whatever qualms Mr. Biden had during earlier stages of his career have all but evaporated.

“On this day, Jill and I are thinking of the courageous couples and fiercely committed advocates who have fought for decades to secure nationwide marriage equality at the Supreme Court and in Congress,” Mr. Biden said in a statement after House passage last week. “We must never stop fighting for full equality for L.G.B.T.Q.I.+ Americans and all Americans.”";https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/us/politics/biden-same-sex-marriage-bill.html
1;Morocco’s showdown with France carries complex political baggage;"Morocco’s journey to the World Cup semifinals has all the makings of a fairy tale. Game after game in Qatar, the unfancied North African side improbably swept past favored opponents, surging to victory with tenacity, bravado and no shortage of talent. Their triumphs have led to moments of transcendence — scenes of joyous celebration in cities across Morocco and beyond as the Atlas Lions became the cause celebre of the Middle East, the Arab world and North Africa.

In Doha, the main staging ground of the tournament, the first African and Arab team to reach this stage of a World Cup are the toast of the town. In European capitals, a broader immigrant North African diaspora has taken to the streets to cheer their success. In the stadiums, Morocco’s work ethic and determination — as well as the bravery of numerous players playing through injuries — has been matched by their perceived sweetness and kindness. Some of the most viral videos from the World Cup are of Moroccan players embracing and dancing with their mothers on the pitch after a victory. Morocco’s underdog heroism has been epitomized by its coach, Walid Regragui, who took over the national team this past August after a successful career at the domestic level. Maher Mezahi, a journalist with expertise on North African soccer, detailed how the French-born Regragui is part of a new wave of sporting leadership on the continent. “He represents everything that is right in African football: He’s young, competent, cosmopolitan, fearless and a pan-Africanist at heart,” Mezahi wrote.

Ahead of Morocco’s epic semifinal clash with France on Wednesday, Regragui cast his team as the proverbial good guys in a Hollywood drama. “We have made our people and our continent so happy and proud,” Regragui told reporters. “When you watch Rocky, you want to support Rocky Balboa and I think we are the Rocky of this World Cup. I think now the world is with Morocco.” But it’s not just feel-good sporting vibes that are driving support for Morocco. On its way to the precipice of a World Cup final, Morocco has defeated a succession of European powers: First Belgium, then cross-strait neighbor Spain and finally Portugal in the quarterfinal. Now, Morocco is set to meet France, which controlled the North African nation as a protectorate for more than four decades in the first half of the 20th century. For a lot of people from the Middle East, Africa and the broader decolonized world, the Moroccan team is “fighting a symbolic war,” argued Monica Marks, a professor of Middle East politics at New York University’s campus in Abu Dhabi. It’s one that taps into “a lingering sense of insult,” she said, “a collective wound to their pride and history” that rankles to this day.

The mushrooming of support for Morocco has touched on various forms of “Global South” solidarity. There is the Pan-Arab jubilation that has followed the Moroccan team throughout the games in Qatar, underscored by the ubiquitous embrace of the Palestinian flag as an emblem of a broader sense of Arab togetherness and struggle. There is African pride for the continent’s pioneering trailblazers at the World Cup and Amazigh, or Berber, pride felt by those rooted in North Africa’s indigenous traditions and cultures. And there is also a groundswell of Muslim excitement for a squad that habitually kneels in prayer after a match.

The sense of delight at Morocco knocking out Europe’s traditional heavyweights is inescapable. On social media, memes abound of Morocco reviving the 8th century Islamic conquests of old, crossing the Pyrenees after laying low both nations of the Iberian peninsula. But it’s a fair bit more complicated than that. The global embrace of Morocco as the champions of the post-colonial world has obscured the extent to which Morocco itself engages in an ongoing form of colonialism — its contested occupation of Western Sahara. “Even in moments of sweeping regional and continental ecstatic glee, a glee that has significant anti-colonial resonance, we also have to appreciate that the Moroccan state itself occupies the uncomfortable position of having been colonized but also being a colonizer,” Marks said. Of course, the Moroccan team is not a reflection of the Moroccan state, as fans worldwide recognize. “If we focus on politics, Morocco is an enemy after choosing Israel as its friend,” Miloud Mohamed, a taxi driver in Algiers, told Voice of America, referring to Morocco’s entry into diplomatic normalization agreements with Israel. “But soccer is not about politics. That’s why I’ve supported Morocco this World Cup.”

Then there’s the roughly 5 million-strong Moroccan diaspora, largely centered in countries in Western Europe. The majority of Morocco’s 26-man squad was born outside of Morocco, mostly in countries like Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Given where most of Morocco’s stars play, it’s a team of Europe, but not for Europe.

In France, the imminent showdown with Morocco has revived political tensions that have swirled around soccer in the country for more than the past two decades. Far-right French politico ?ric Zemmour went on television this week to denounce the French citizens of North African descent who may take to the streets to cheer for Morocco over their home nation. Other far-right and traditional right-wing politicians have cast these celebrations as security threats; there were reports of clashes between revelers and police in various European cities after Morocco’s victories.

Morocco’s World Cup win lifts a legion of Arab fans

The irony is that France’s team itself is a reflection of a multiculturalism that makes the French establishment uncomfortable. The team is largely drawn from African and Arab immigrant communities with connections to France’s former colonies. And over the years, its success has been seen as a valediction of French integration and its failures as an indictment on the “separatist” tendencies of certain minorities. As French striker Karim Benzema famously said, “If I score, I’m French; if I don’t, I’m Arab.” The current Moroccan and French teams are no strangers to each other. Some of the players on both sides grew up in the same neighborhoods, turn up for the same super clubs and indulge in the same gaudy lifestyles of soccer’s super rich. Their national team affiliations belie a shared context.

France’s political elite still struggle with the concept of hyphenated identities in a country that is institutionally colorblind (though, in practice, not quite). French President Emmanuel Macron, who is set to attend Wednesday’s semifinal in Qatar, even bemoaned the supposed infiltration of American “identity politics” among some of France’s minority communities.

But Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French legal scholar and political commentator of Algerian descent, told me the clash between France and Morocco will showcase a generation of athletes who have further advanced the conversation around identity, no matter what the political class says. “There’s a generation that is connected to the rest of the world, that is creating its own French identity, composed of multiple cultures,” Alouane said. She added that the Moroccan team, which includes players who could have represented France, “is the crystallization of this hyphenated identity at its peak, a recognition that we live in a globalized world where you can choose the team you want to play for diverse reasons.”

That’s a realization that doesn’t sit well for some. “In right-wing circles, they keep telling you that you don’t belong, that you’re not integrated enough,” Alouane said. “Then, you play in the national team and they warn there are too many Arabs or Black people on the team. Of course, that changes when you win.”

“At a point,” she concluded, “the people who have an issue with identity are not the ones you think.”";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/13/morocco-france-world-cup-history-politics-baggage/
1;Hong Kong eases covid restrictions for arrivals, scraps tracking app;"After more than two years of rigid pandemic rules, arrivals to Hong Kong will be allowed to move around the city freely if they test negative for the coronavirus, the city’s chief executive, John Lee, told reporters Tuesday.

In a sudden turnaround, Hong Kong residents will also no longer be required to scan the “Leave Home Safe” tracking app when entering shops or restaurants.

While there are still some restrictions in Hong Kong, such as mandated masking, the financial center is joining mainland China in a broader push toward easing restrictions.

Lee said the decision to further ease arrival rules was made after an analysis of infection risks by the city’s health officials. The infection risk from “imported cases is actually lower than risk of added local infections within a community,” he said at a news conference.

China prepares for exit wave of infections as it relaxes covid policies

Travelers to Hong Kong have endured various restrictions, including a harsh 21-day quarantine upon entry. The city scrapped this requirement in September, moving to a “0+3” rule, which meant that arrivals could not step into restaurants, bars or other venues for three days while they performed medical monitoring but were otherwise free to move around. The strict coronavirus rules have undermined Hong Kong’s role as a regional aviation hub. Although Hong Kong International Airport is significantly busier than it was before mandatory hotel quarantine was scrapped, it is not back to pre-covid levels. By contrast, cities such as Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo have lifted travel restrictions, allowing tourists to visit with minimal restrictions.

Hong Kong’s tough rules have also triggered a brain drain, as international talent leaves for alternative global hubs such as Singapore or Dubai.

Tourists have also expressed frustration. In November, as Hong Kong hosted the Rugby Sevens tournament, a handful of ticket holders were turned away because the code displayed on their tracking apps was still colored amber, indicating they were still within the three-day monitoring period. They included Renier Du Plessis, from South Africa, who was finally allowed into venues after he became known as #AmberCodeMan on Twitter. This week’s decision is a step in the right direction, said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. Neither the “Leave Home Safe” tracking app nor the three-day restriction was “contributing much to covid control locally,” he said. But “it was never going to be a complete cancellation of all measures” due to the rise in coronavirus cases and deaths in recent days, he said.

There were 158 deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the past seven days in Hong Kong, a jump from 108 in the previous week, according to government figures. The city has also seen the daily average of new infections increase to about 13,460 in the past seven days, from around 9,370 in the prior week.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/13/hong-kong-covid-travel-restrictions-update/
1;BTS megastar Jin starts military service in South Korea;"SEOUL — K-pop singer Jin, the oldest member of South Korean supergroup BTS, started his military service on Tuesday, becoming the first in the band to do so — much to the grief of millions of his fans — though few showed up to bid farewell.

Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, was driven straight into the military base, without stopping for a send-off, “in order to prevent any accident from crowding,” said his agency, HYBE. Fans obeyed the pleas of the band and avoided gathering for a send off.

Fearing the scene would be mobbed, authorities had set up a “situation room” to monitor any potential safety hazards and some 270 riot police were deployed. Tuesday’s rigorous safety measures come amid heightened awareness for crowd control in South Korea following a deadly Halloween crush in Seoul. Ambulances were also on standby around the Key Recruit Training Center, where Jin entered boot camp at a front-line division in Yeoncheon county on the border with North Korea.

BTS’s Jin enlists: What to know about S. Korea’s mandatory military service

The enlistment of Korean celebrities often attracts fans and journalists trying to catch a glimpse of the stars before they leave the public eye for about two years. Scores of reporters and photographers were on hand to catch the star from early in the morning but only a few dozen well-wishers came after Jin told the “BTS Army” — the official name of the boy band’s millions-strong fan base — not to come. Instead, the training center was surrounded with colorful banners rooting for the K-pop star, including one carried by giant balloons in the sky. “Kim Seok-jin, you’ve been a universe to us,” one of the banners read.

Enrollment day at a training center is usually busy with recruits and their families exchanging emotional goodbyes. The 30-year-old singer joins boot camp with a cohort of about 200 other conscripts, many of whom are younger than him.

All able-bodied South Korean men between the ages of 18 and 28 must serve at least 18 months in the country’s armed forces, but K-pop stars like Jin who are recognized by the government can defer their service until age 30. The K-pop heartthrob sent social media abuzz earlier when he revealed his freshly shaved head. The South Korean army maintains rigid grooming standards, including hair length regulations. “It’s cuter than I thought,” he said in a message posted on the Weverse fan community on Sunday. Jin will undergo a physically demanding five-week basic training course before being assigned to a military unit. Army trainees learn basic skills such as how to march, shoot guns and throw a grenade.

The six other members of BTS are expected to fulfill their draft obligations based on individual timelines. BTS, hailed as the world’s biggest boy band, plans to reconvene as a group in 2025 after they complete their service. They traveled to the border town of Yeoncheon with Jin to bid him farewell in person, according to HYBE.

Jin made his solo debut in October with the hit single “The Astronaut,” which sold more than a million copies. ";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/bts-jin-military-service-south-korea/
1;"Ukraine live briefing: G-7 leaders pledge ‘unwavering support’ for Kyiv; E.U. approves major economic assistance";"President Biden met virtually with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, and leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations Monday.

“I joined G7 Leaders and President Zelenskyy to discuss the progress we’ve made under Germany’s presidency to address pressing challenges of our time — Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine, climate, food and energy security, infrastructure, and more,” Biden said on Twitter. “We’re more united than ever.”

In a joint statement, the G-7 leaders condemned Russia’s “unprovoked war of aggression” and nuclear brinkmanship, reaffirmed commitments to move away from Russian fossil fuels and pledged ongoing support for Ukraine’s economy and military.

Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.

1. Key developments
WNBA star Brittney Griner is undergoing medical evaluations at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio after Russian authorities released her from a Moscow jail last week in a prisoner exchange with the United States. Roger D. Carstens, the Biden administration’s hostage affairs envoy, described Griner as healthy and full of energy in an interview with CNN on Sunday.
The White House will engage with Russia this week on efforts to free Paul Whelan, a former Marine who is serving 16 years in a Russian prison, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Members of the Biden administration virtually met with Elizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan’s sister, earlier Monday. “The conversations with Paul Whelan’s family have been substantive,” Sullivan said. “We are bound and determined to ensure that we work through a successful method of securing Paul Whelan’s release at the earliest possible opportunity.”
Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was swapped by the United States for Griner, joined an ultranationalist political party just days after returning to Russia. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) confirmed Bout’s membership Monday, posting a video to Telegram that showed him standing on a stage next to party leader Leonid Slutsky.
The European Council approved 18 billion euros ($18.9 billion) in financial assistance for Ukraine for 2023. In a statement Monday, the council said the assistance will provide short-term financial relief, finance Ukraine’s immediate needs and rehabilitate critical infrastructure.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will not hold his traditional end-of-year news conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, the first time he will skip the event in at least a decade. The conference is infamous among reporters in Moscow for lasting several hours. It is one of the rare occasions when journalists from outside the Kremlin pool can question Putin directly.
2. Battleground updates
Russian forces are making slow, incremental gains in their fight to take the Ukrainian city of Bahkmut, a senior U.S. military official said Monday, as intense fighting there continues. “The Ukrainians continue to hold the line,” the military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon.
Western military experts say Russia is firing larger batches of missiles at Ukraine, which risks depleting Kyiv’s stockpiles of interceptor missiles. Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp., wrote in a Twitter thread that Russia is trying to “confuse and overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.”
Russian forces are also launching an increasing number of “dud” artillery shells in Ukraine, as they rely more frequently on older ammunition after months of fighting, the U.S. military official said. The trend has become evident as Ukrainians more frequently find unexploded ordnance, the official said. Nearly 10 months into its invasion, Russia has burned through a large number of its munitions, prompting it to look to outside nations, such as Iran, for more, the official said.
Moscow-backed officials accused Ukrainian forces of using U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets to attack the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol over the weekend. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the strike. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, said the attack hit a church seized by Russian troops for use as a base several months ago.
3. Global impact
The E.U. will have enough natural gas this winter but could face shortages in 2023, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said Monday at a European Commission news conference. “This winter, it looks like we are off the hook,” he said. But he warned that next year would be more difficult if European temperatures return to their colder averages, if the capacity to import liquefied natural gas isn’t ramped up, and if Russia continues reducing its gas supplies to Europe. “Next year it is very likely that we won’t have any Russian gas in our system,” Birol warned.
The E.U., in a statement Monday, condemned Iran’s military support, including the supply of drones, for Russia’s war in Ukraine. The E.U. Council announced sanctions against four Iranian individuals and as many entities for the supply of drones to Russia. “These weapons provided by Iran are being used indiscriminately by Russia against Ukrainian civilian population and infrastructure causing horrendous destruction and human suffering,” the statement said.
More than 82,000 Ukrainians and their families have arrived in the United States since the war began as part of a special program that allows them to stay for two years, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a report. The agency said it has confirmed the financial suitability of more than 177,000 U.S. supporters for the arrivals through its “Uniting for Ukraine” program. 4. From our correspondents
Ukrainian lawmaker who idolizes former U.S. president Reagan tries to win over today’s Republicans: Maryan Zablotskyy grew up venerating Ronald Reagan in Lviv, in western Ukraine — as many did in the post-Soviet years. Now a member of parliament, Zablotskyy, 37, faces the prospect that the Republicans, the party of his favorite American politician, could turn against Ukraine in its moment of greatest need — under invasion and relentless bombing by Russia, with about one-fifth of its land occupied and its economy in tatters, writes Jeff Stein from Kyiv.

1;U.S. says it can’t seek death penalty against accused Lockerbie bomber;"Prosecutors said in federal court Monday that the law does not allow them to seek the death penalty for the former Libyan intelligence officer charged with building the bomb that destroyed a passenger plane flying over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people, including 190 Americans.

Abu Agela Mas’ud Kheir al-Marimi, 71, made his first appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Monday afternoon, a day after U.S. authorities announced that they had extradited him. He would be the first person prosecuted in the United States in connection with the attack 34 years ago.

The Justice Department years ago charged two other men in connection with the killings, but Libyan officials never agreed to allow them to appear in an American courtroom. Instead, they were prosecuted by a Scottish court. Officials so far have declined to say what agreement they struck with Libya to bring Mas’ud to the United States. Mas’ud faces two different criminal charges, including destruction of an aircraft resulting in death. He could be sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors told Magistrate Judge Robin M. Meriweather that while the charges Mas’ud faces now are punishable by death, they were not eligible for the death penalty in 1988.

The Lockerbie bombing launched a global probe. Here’s what to know.

Mas’ud, who was born in Tunisia and also holds Libyan citizenship, appeared with a public defender, limping into the courtroom wearing a green jail jumpsuit. Relatives of victims killed in the bombing were present. Speaking in Arabic through a translator, he told the judge that he had the flu and was taking medication, and that he wanted to obtain his own lawyer but had not yet done so. “I cannot talk before I have my attorney,” Mas’ud said.

Meriweather agreed to delay the detention hearing until Dec. 27.

Until Sept. 11, 2001, the bombing of the Boeing 747 was the largest terrorist attack against U.S. civilians in history. It led to sanctions against Libya and helped shape the FBI’s handling of international investigations.

In 1991, Libyan intelligence operative Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and his alleged accomplice Lamen Khalifa Fhimah were charged in the Lockerbie bombing. Libya initially refused to send them to the United States or Britain for trial, instead handing them over in 1999 for trial by a Scottish court on a former U.S. military base in the Netherlands. Fhimah was acquitted, while Megrahi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Megrahi died in 2012, about three years after being released from prison with a cancer diagnosis.

Mas’ud was charged years later, after the FBI obtained a copy of a 2012 interview of him by a Libyan law enforcement officer.

According to the U.S. affidavit filed in support of the criminal case, Mas’ud admitted making the bomb that took down the plane and assisting Megrahi and Fhimah in executing the plot.

Mas’ud has been in Libyan custody in an unrelated case.

State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to give details Monday of what led to his transfer to the United States. “It is safe to say that this happened in consultation with appropriate Libyan authorities and the United States is in regular contact and discussion with our Libyan counterparts, but I would need to leave it at that,” Price told reporters at a briefing.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/12/12/masud-lockerbie-death-penalty-court/
1;Australia in shock as deadly shootout in rural town kills police officers;"Two police officers were killed in a shootout at a property in rural Australia, after what initially appeared to be a routine follow-up to a missing-person report turned into an ambush and a lengthy siege, Queensland police said Tuesday.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The shootout took place Monday afternoon in the Wieambilla locality of Queensland, roughly 200 miles west of Brisbane. A bystander who reportedly tried to help was also killed. Three suspected offenders, whom police say were inside the property with “considerable weaponry,” were later shot and killed by specialist forces dispatched to the scene.

Another police officer was injured, while a fourth feared she would be burned alive, police said.

Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said Tuesday during a news conference that many questions remain about the incident, including what motivated the suspects and that an investigation is underway. It will likely take “days, if not weeks” to clarify what happened, she said. In the meantime, the incident has shaken Australia, a country whose experience with gun violence spurred it to adopt stricter gun laws in the late 1990s. Research suggests that Australia had fewer gun deaths after those laws were passed. Shootings resulting in multiple deaths, particularly involving law enforcement, are rare.

“All Australians are shocked and saddened by this tragic loss of life,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday. “This is not a price that anyone who puts on a uniform should ever pay.”

How countries around the world have responded to mass shootings

Police say the incident began around 4:30 p.m. local time, when four police officers were dispatched to a property on Wains Road at Wieambilla to follow up on a request from New South Wales Police to check on a missing person.

The person, identified by authorities and Australian media as Nathaniel Train, 46, a former school principal in New South Wales, was reported missing a year earlier. He had been heard from sporadically, though contact had ceased in recent days, prompting the request from NSW Police, according to Carroll. Train was one of three people inside the property, according to authorities. Australian news outlets reported that the other two were Train’s brother, Gareth Train, 47, and Gareth’s wife, Stacey Train, 45. All three people inside the property are suspected offenders in this case, Carroll said Tuesday during a news conference.

When the officers arrived, they were “inundated with gunfire,” Ian Leavers, the president of the Queensland Police Union, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

Two officers from the Tara Police Service — Matthew Arnold, 26, and Rachel McCrow, 29 — were shot and died at the scene. A neighbor, identified by authorities as Alan Dare, 58, was also shot and killed when he approached the property — driven, according to Albanese, “by the instinct to help.”

The officers’ age and relative inexperience in the force — Arnold was sworn in as a police officer in March 2020, while McCrow was sworn in June 2021 — has added to what officials have described as the tragic nature of the events.

It is with a heavy heart we confirm the deaths of Constable Matthew Arnold and Constable Rachel McCrow.

Their lives were cut tragically short in the line of duty at Wieambilla yesterday.

The other two officers at the scene — constables Randall Kirk, 28, and Keely Brough, 28, both from Chinchilla Police Station — survived. Kirk sustained a gunshot injury, while Brough managed to flee into the nearby long grass, Leavers said. He told Australian media that the suspects lit the grass on fire to try to force Brough into the open. “She did not know whether she was going to be shot or she was going to be burned alive,” Leavers said.

After the surviving officers raised the alarm, 16 officers arrived at the scene, facing heavy gunfire, to retrieve their colleagues’ bodies, Leavers and Carroll said. Specialist forces fatally shot the suspects around 10:30 p.m. local time, police say, putting an end to the siege. Carrol described the incident as “the largest loss of … police life we have suffered in a single incident in many years,” as she fought back tears on Tuesday.

“Losing one of their own has a profound impact on every single officer and their families; to lose two officers in one incident is absolutely devastating,” she said.

“In my opinion, those officers did not stand a chance. The fact that two got out alive is a miracle,” she added. Over the coming weeks, law enforcement will comb the lives and records of the suspects, looking for clues about what may have motivated them to go on this deadly rampage.

One possible track relates to Gareth Train’s online life: According to the Guardian Australia, Train was a conspiracy theorist who believed the false claim that the Port Arthur massacre of 1996 — when an Australian gunman killed 35 people, prompting lawmakers to pass stricter gun laws — was a “false-flag operation.” It’s not clear whether Train’s beliefs played any part in the shooting, but Carroll said police would be looking into those reports.

On Tuesday, Australians dropped off flowers at police stations across Queensland, as the nation mourned the loss of two young officers whose lives and careers, Carroll said, were just getting started.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/13/police-shooting-wieambilla-australia/

Majid Reza Rahnavard, 23, was hanged from a construction crane. A video of the execution spreading across social media shows his suspended body, dressed in white with his hands bound behind him, slowly spinning in the predawn dark as a crowd gathers around.

Rahnavard was convicted of fatally stabbing two members of Iran’s security forces with a knife on Nov. 17, according to Mizan, the official news site of the judiciary. The site published a photo of men in black ski masks at the execution site.

Rahnavard is the second protester to be executed in the past week, and the first to have his body displayed publicly, as the government seeks to crush a national uprising that challenges its rule. Mohsen Shekari, accused of injuring a member of the security forces, was executed on Thursday. The protests that started after the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini in mid-September in the custody of the “morality police” have become a broad-based movement uniting opponents of clerical rule across class and ethnic lines.

Iran’s regime at an impasse as protest movement defies crackdown

Nearly 500 civilians have been killed and some 18,000 arrested in the unrest, according to estimates by the HRANA activist news agency, but restrictions on reporting make exact numbers difficult to verify. At least 16 people have been given death sentences for their role in the protests, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, based in New York.

Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said Monday that the European Union will approve a new round of sanctions against Iran.

“Iran has to understand that the European Union will condemn strongly and will take any action we can in order to support Iranian women, to support peaceful demonstrators and, certainly, reject the death penalty,” Borrell said. A video from Rahnavard’s gravesite shows a handful of women wailing, with one saying “May God curse you” to his executioners.

Rahnavard’s family was not informed about his pending execution, according to 1500 Tasvir, an anti-government group that monitors the demonstrations. His mother visited him in prison recently and she “left smiling and hoping that her son would be released soon,” the group wrote in an online post.

Political prisoners such as Rahnavard are typically tried in revolutionary courts, a parallel legal system that is stacked against the accused. During his trial, Rahnavard confessed to the stabbings, and a video of the alleged incident was shown by the prosecution.

But such trials often rely on fabricated evidence, and defendants are frequently tortured or forced into making confessions and incriminating statements, as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have repeatedly documented. “The public execution of a young protester, 23 days after his arrest, is another serious crime committed by the Islamic Republic leaders and a significant escalation of the level of violence against protesters,” said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Oslo-based Iran Human Rights. “Majidreza Rahnavard was sentenced to death based on coerced confessions, after a grossly unfair process and a show trial.”";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/iran-execution-protests-majidreza-rahnavard/
1;Parched Peru is restoring pre-Incan dikes to solve its water problem;"SAN PEDRO DE CASTA, Peru — On a mountainside high above Peru’s capital, Javier Obispo pauses from the backbreaking work of renovating an amuna. The abandoned irrigation dike distributed water before Europeans came to South America.

With Lima’s water supply under increasing pressure, the 42-year-old veterinary technician has been working with other villagers here to bring the ancient technology back to life. The steep Andean slopes, dotted with small cactuses wielding outsize thorns, tower around us, a parched shade of light brown. Climate change is making itself felt.

“Twenty years ago, the soil would be damp. There used to be waterfalls,” says Obispo, gesturing at a dusty bluff above. “Now, there just isn’t enough pasture anymore. What’s it going to be like in 2030?” But now the water is beginning to trickle, for perhaps the first time in centuries.

The amunas — permeable stone-and-adobe walls 18 inches high that run for miles across this imposing landscape — divert excess water from streams that during the rainy season would otherwise flow uncontrolled down the mountains and eventually be lost in the Pacific Ocean.

Peru has had five presidents in 25 years. Can Boluarte stick?

They then infiltrate that water into the soil, replenishing the water table and ensuring its gradual release throughout the year in natural springs. The ancient technology also improves water purity and helps prevent erosion and landslides. Obispo is one of a dozen villagers laboring together in the tropical mountain sun to rescue this five-mile-long amuna, excavating it from the accumulated earth and refurbishing it in a pilot project that holds promise for this arid landscape.

“The amunas are the only hope,” says Obispo, who lives here in a community of 400. “Without them, San Pedro de Casta will die.” Yet the project, organized by the local nonprofit Aquafondo, is intended to also benefit populations far beyond this remote region. A hair-raising four-hour drive some 13,000 feet below lies Lima, thought to be the world’s third most populous desert city, after Cairo and Karachi, Pakistan.

Nestled beside the Pacific in what is effectively a northern extension of South America’s Atacama Desert, the location of Peru’s chaotic capital of 10 million was chosen in the 1500s by the conquering Spaniards rather than the ecologically savvy Indigenous residents — and has become increasingly problematic with the explosive growth of recent decades. Lima’s water supply is dependent largely on three small rivers that descend from the Andes and fluctuate during the year from bone dry to raging torrents whose volume can overwhelm the state-owned water utility.

The company, Sedapal, has invested heavily in high-altitude reservoirs above San Pedro de Casta and initiated the construction of several costly desalination plants, to remove salt from ocean water. Yet Lima still suffers a water gap of about 100 cubic feet per second. That means that roughly 1 million poorer inhabitants on the margins of the city lack running water. They rely instead on an unregulated fleet of tanker trucks dispensing untreated water at rates 10 times greater than those paid by more affluent lime?os connected to water lines.

The deficit could be made up almost entirely by water delivered by amunas, researchers have calculated. To get there, Peru would have to restore hundreds of miles of the prehistoric dikes across all three watersheds that serve Lima.

“The idea is first to help the local community, the guardians of the water. Otherwise, we would just be using them,” says Mariella S?nchez, Aquafondo’s executive director. “But the objective is the same for those who live downstream in Lima: To improve living conditions.”

'The whole world eats well and we do not'

The San Pedro de Casta model, which is being funded by Backus, Peru’s largest beer and beverages company, and GIZ, Germany’s international aid agency, is one of several pilots being attempted by different nonprofits. 
The development of the amunas around 600 B.C., centuries before the rise of the Incas, remains shrouded in mystery because Andean cultures did not develop writing. Their revival now could be scaled nationally to benefit other coastal cities.

Indigenous leaders get a choice: Join the narcos or run for your lives

As the source of the Amazon River, Peru is blessed with abundant fresh water. But 98 percent of its precipitation cycles eastward, from the Andes and the Amazon toward Bolivia, Colombia, Brazil and the Atlantic, while two-thirds of its 33 million people live on the country’s arid western coastal strip.

The effects of the climate crisis in the Peruvian Andes are complex. The highest of Lima’s watersheds are receiving slightly more precipitation than before, but in more intense, harder to manage bursts. Lower down, at the level of San Pedro de Casta, there is less. Obispo says the rains that once ran from around Christmas through April now typically arrive in mid-January and end in mid-March. Local herds of cows and goats have dropped 40 percent, he says, while harvests of potatoes, corn and broad beans have dropped between 30 and 50 percent.

Peru's president impeached, arrested after he tries to dissolve congress

Reviving the amunas could be complemented by projects to restore the puna, the high-altitude tundra ecosystem that, when healthy, holds water like a sponge.

A consortium of nongovernmental organizations, backed by the U.S. Agency for International Development and involving researchers from Imperial College London, have begun the sensitive work of encouraging mountain communities to swap their horses and cattle for more sustainable llamas and alpacas. The native South American camelids have soft foot pads and nibble only the tips of the grass — unlike the imported livestock, which pull up the slow-growing vegetation by the roots while their hoofs compact the soil.

These green measures can cost 100 times less per cubic foot of water than investing in gray infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs. Sedapal views the different approaches as complementary and equally necessary to ensure Lima’s water security in the coming decades.

For San Pedro de Casta, the benefits of restoring the local amunas are expected to come much more quickly, over the next 12 months. “This could be a turning point,” says Obispo. “We’re hoping that some people who have left the village will now even consider coming back.”";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/peru-lima-water-shortage-amunas/
1;Japan to buy Tomahawk missiles in defense buildup amid fears of war;"TOKYO — Alarmed by increasing security threats and the risk of war in the Indo-Pacific, Japan will seek to purchase hundreds of U.S.-built Tomahawk cruise missiles as part of a major defense buildup unprecedented in the postwar period, Japanese and U.S. officials said.

The missile buy would boost Japan’s long-range strike capability and mark a stunning break with a long tradition of eschewing offensive weapons. And it would enhance Japan’s conventional deterrent as China undertakes a sweeping military modernization and North Korea barrels ahead with its nuclear program.

Japan will move forward on the Tomahawk decision as a part of the rollout of its new national security and defense strategies this month, along with a major hike in Japan’s defense budget — to the NATO benchmark of 2 percent of gross domestic product, which would make it the third-largest in the world. Together, these steps signal a Japan moving to shed its longtime pacifist constraints.

Russia’s invasion prompts more assertive foreign policy from Japan

“Japan wanted to limit its defense spending and try not to acquire second-strike capability. But the situation surrounding us does not permit us to do that,” said Ichiro Fujisaki, former Japanese ambassador to the United States. “Many people thought [war] was a 20th-century issue, but we are now seeing that again.” The missile acquisition and the growing defense budget have the support of the Biden administration, which views Japan as a pivotal partner in the western Pacific. Officials see a deepening alliance with Japan as part of a broader strategy of regional cooperation to enhance security, including a deal involving the United States and Britain helping Australia develop nuclear-powered submarines, and the United States lifting limits on South Korea building ballistic missiles.

“The United States is not just taking unilateral steps, but is seeking to empower allies and partners in ways that are deeply significant and magnify our capacities in the region,” said a U.S. official who, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that are not yet public.

The decision to buy hundreds of Tomahawks — 400 to 500 by some accounts — will put China and North Korea on notice that Japan is serious about self-defense, and that the bilateral alliance — arguably the most significant militarily in the region — is growing stronger in the face of threats from Beijing and Pyongyang, officials said. “The introduction of this system will symbolize a major positive change regarding counterstrike capabilities,” a Japanese official said. The Tomahawk missiles, with a 1,000-mile-plus range, would put military targets on mainland China within reach. While Japan has gradually been shifting away from self-defense-oriented policies — a 2014 reinterpretation of its constitution allowed for military action in the event an ally was attacked — change had been incremental.

Until now.

Key Asian nations join global backlash against Russia, with an eye toward China

Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine was “absolutely” a pivotal factor in creating the political climate that allowed the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to push a strong national security agenda over anti-militarist public sentiment, a second Japanese official said.

Polls show that post-Ukraine, public support for what the Japanese government calls “counterstrike” capability has clearly risen, from 37 percent in July 2020 to over 60 percent in June.

For the Japanese, the war in Ukraine has made a Chinese invasion of Taiwan appear much more possible, deepening the public’s concern over Japan’s military readiness in the event of a regional conflict. In August, after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited Taipei, an outraged Beijing carried out aggressive military drills near Taiwan, including the launch of a ballistic missile that landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone. And over the past year, North Korea has tested an unprecedented number of ballistic missiles as it pursues its nuclear weapons program, even sending one over Japan.

“This represents a significant evolution in Japan’s strategic thinking,” said Jeffrey Hornung, an expert in Japanese security and foreign policy at the Washington-based Rand Corp. “China’s behavior over the last 10 years has really put Japan on a trajectory of thinking more seriously about its defense.” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has pushed a more assertive foreign policy agenda since February. Late last month, he took the extraordinary step of saying he wanted to grow the defense budget to 2 percent of GDP by 2027 — a move long considered controversial and implausible. If he succeeds, Japan in five years likely would have the world’s third-largest defense budget after the United States and China. Japan views the Tomahawk missiles as a “stopgap” weapon that could be delivered within five or so years, as it works to extend the range of its own Type 12 cruise missiles to have a similar ability to attack military targets on land from a distance. But that project is likely to be a 10-year effort, experts said.

Japan plans to reconfigure existing vertical launch systems on its destroyers to accommodate the Tomahawks, officials said. The Tomahawks were a top choice because they are “combat proven long-range fires,” the first Japanese official said.

In Japan and across Asia, an outpouring of support for Ukraine

The Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, or TLAMs, are built by Raytheon. They were notably used in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, demonstrating that targets could be struck at long range with precision. They would give Japan the ability to strike bases on Chinese or North Korean soil, unlike its current array of missiles, which are geared for invaders closer to Japanese territory. Possessing Tomahawks would “add a lot” to Japan’s conventional deterrent, said retired Adm. Phil Davidson, the former head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. “You’ve got to have some offensive capability,” said Davidson, who retired last year. “You can’t win the World Cup without scoring a goal. You can’t just play defense all the time. If you’re going to have a deterrent capability, your adversary has to feel they’re at risk.”

The benefits would accrue to partners in the region as well, said Christopher B. Johnstone, Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies: “A Japan that is capable of striking back on its own would make a significant contribution to deterrence in East Asia.”

Japan and the United States already cooperate closely in military technology, former officials noted. The Japanese fly the F-35 fighter jet and use the Aegis missile defense system, both built by U.S. contractor Lockheed Martin. They run joint ballistic missile defense exercises at sea, including a successful one last month off Hawaii.

Road to war: U.S. struggled to convince allies, and Zelensky, of risk of invasion

Japanese officials say the move would also deepen U.S. confidence in Japan’s will and ability to shoulder its defense burden.  “We are backing our intention with the budget and security strategy,” said the second Japanese official. “And that should elevate U.S. confidence in Japanese capability. That kind of confidence is important for the alliance.”

To date only Britain has been sold the Tomahawks, noted Hornung, from Rand. The United States selling to Japan “sends a message that you are in our top tier of really trustworthy countries as allies,” he said.

China has bristled at Japan’s shift. At a briefing this month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning called Japan’s plans a “very dangerous” development.

“Japan needs to earnestly reflect on its history of aggression, respect the security concerns of Asian neighbors, act prudently in the field of military security, and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability,” Mao said. In May, Japan’s national security adviser, Takeo Akiba, met in Washington with his White House counterpart, Jake Sullivan, and broached the idea of buying Tomahawks, according to people familiar with the matter. Sullivan, they said, was receptive. “We’ll start a process to look at it,” he told Akiba, according to the people. “And we’ll stay in touch with you.”

Tokyo has not yet made a formal request to purchase the weapons, officials said.

The government is still sensitive to domestic antiwar sentiment and is steadfastly framing the weapons in terms of self-defense. “It’s defensive-offensive — not offense-offense,” said the second official. “We still consider it defensive.”

But, the official conceded, “this [move] is quite extraordinary. The Tomahawk is very significant.”

Japan was the first Asian nation to join the West in imposing sanctions on Russia over its invasion, leading Russia to label it an “unfriendly” country and to increase its military activity in the vicinity.

Officials in Tokyo saw how NATO support for Kyiv increased after it demonstrated a will to fight in the face of long odds, said Johnstone, until June a White House director for East Asia: “They concluded the best way to ensure the United States and others are in their corner in a crisis was to show they had invested in their own defense and were prepared to fight. That is the central lesson of the Ukraine war for Japan.” Indeed, Japan is poised to take a remarkable turn in its defense posture in many ways beyond just new hardware and increased spending. This month, the Defense Ministry is also expected to announce an increase of its cybersecurity team to 20,000 by 2027, up from the current 800, staffing up the government to close major gaps in its cybersecurity capabilities.

Japan is also considering making it easier for the Self-Defense Forces to use civilian ports and airports in peacetime, a further reflection of its concerns over readiness in case of conflict.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/japan-tomahawk-missiles-ukraine-war/
1;Covid spreads and medical staff sicken after China relaxes restrictions;"Chinese hospitals scrambled to contain emerging outbreaks across the country Monday as authorities rolled back more than two years of coronavirus controls.

After widespread protests against the government’s strict “zero covid” policies, authorities last week announced a dramatic loosening of requirements for testing, digital health passes, and tracking and quarantines. In the days since, hospitals have reported a surge in patients while hundreds of medical staffers have contracted the virus.

Beijing municipal officials said at a briefing Monday that 22,000 patients visited fever clinics the day before, 16 times the daily average a week ago.

China prepares for exit wave of infections as it relaxes covid policies

“Hospitals bore the brunt of zero covid and are now overwhelmed by an unprecedented outbreak,” said Yan, an eye surgeon in Beijing who disclosed only her surname because she was not authorized to speak to media. More than half of the staff members in her hospital had tested positive in the past week. “Patients who visit the fever clinic have grown several times compared with last week, and it’s likely to go on for weeks or even months more,” she said.

A surge in cases is likely to overwhelm China’s health-care system, which has been focused for the past three years on contact tracing and quarantines rather than building up capacity for coronavirus outbreaks. China has 4.5 intensive care unit beds for every 100,000 people, according to government data, and its latest ambition to double its ICU capacity by the end of December is proving to be harder to achieve than expected.

The National Health Commission on Sunday launched an initiative to ensure that major county-level hospitals are stocked up on medical supplies and ICU equipment. Hospitals have been ordered to expand their staffs by 20 to 30 percent and establish an infectious-disease department by the end of December. The commission said Friday that it would ensure 90 percent of rural hospitals have fever clinics, while temporary quarantine centers, known as fangcang, will be converted into hospitals.

China logged 8,838 positive tests Sunday, a figure residents said does not reflect the true scope of infections because centralized testing, the only way new infections were identified, has been removed. A contact-tracing app monitoring residents’ movements will cease to function as of Tuesday, and all user data is to be deleted.

Cities pleaded with residents not to call emergency services if their symptoms were not serious, while community and rural clinics complained they were short-staffed, according to local media reports. Panicked residents are stockpiling antigen tests and medication. Karen Bai, 36, who lives in Shijiazhuang in Hebei province, has had a fever for three days but has not been able to acquire any at-home tests. Suffering from a blood disease, she is immunocompromised, and her doctor has advised her to stay away from hospitals. “So many patients have covid but they don’t know it,” she said. “Everyone has been saying life is going to return to normal, but to me it’s gone from bad to worse.”

China’s pursuit of zero covid has resulted in a low level of natural immunity among the public, leaving the population vulnerable. Authorities are especially focused on protecting the elderly, who have lower vaccination rates and are the target of a current vaccination drive. Zhong Wenhong, a Shanghai-based infectious-disease expert, advised elderly residents to refrain from group activities such as dancing in public squares or playing mah-jongg for at least one month.

The Caixin news site reported earlier this month that China aims to vaccinate 90 percent of those ages 80 and above with at least a first shot, but officials have refrained from announcing a specific target given hesitancy among the elderly to get immunized. Just 40 percent of Chinese older than 80 have received a booster shot, despite months of campaigning and gift-giving to encourage uptake.  Last week, government adviser Feng Zijian, a former official with the National Health Commission, predicted that 60 percent of the population could be infected in the first wave of infections. Authorities expect an upsurge in cases around Lunar New Year in late January. China’s coronavirus cases could peak in a month, but it is “more complicated” to predict when the outbreak will end, experts have said.

“In the short run, there will be a massive demand for ICU resources as severe cases rise,” Zhang Ming, the deputy head of the intensive care unit at Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai, told the financial news outlet Yicai, adding that bigger hospitals in bigger cities tend to be more prepared but that he “cannot speak for the situation in general.”

Amid fear of the virus and after more than two years of official media warnings of its dangers, misinformation has spread, with residents buying up canned peaches after rumors that they would prevent contagion and experts weighing in on whether better-looking people are less likely to contract the virus.

Still, residents say they welcome the opening. “It’s a risk worth taking,” said Yan, the doctor in Beijing. “If the lockdown had gone on, more people would have died from poverty and starvation even if they stayed covid-free.” ";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/china-covid-rules-loosened-winter-wave/
1;Cause of death: Washington faltered as fentanyl gripped America;"During the past seven years, as soaring quantities of fentanyl flooded into the United States, strategic blunders and cascading mistakes by successive U.S. administrations allowed the most lethal drug crisis in American history to become significantly worse, a Washington Post investigation has found.

Presidents from both parties failed to take effective action in the face of one of the most urgent threats to the nation’s security, one that claims more lives each year than car accidents, suicides or gun violence. Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49, according to a Post analysis.

The Drug Enforcement Administration, the country’s premier anti-narcotics agency, stumbled through a series of missteps as it confronted the biggest challenge in its 50-year history. The agency was slow to respond as Mexican cartels supplanted Chinese producers, creating a massive illicit pharmaceutical industry that is now producing more fentanyl than ever. The Department of Homeland Security, whose agencies are responsible for detecting illegal drugs at the nation’s borders, failed to ramp up scanning and inspection technology at official crossings, instead channeling $11 billion toward the construction of a border wall that does little to stop fentanyl traffickers.

The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the executive branch office headed by the “drug czar” and tasked with coordinating the government’s response, spent years fending off elimination and struggled to create an effective strategy to combat the scourge. The office lost its seat in the White House Cabinet and remains sidelined.

“Law enforcement did the best it could,” said David King, executive director of a federal drug task force in San Diego. “We can only do so much. But in Washington, they have been very slow to respond to this and now we are at the confluence of paralysis.” The DEA said it is now taking direct aim at the Mexican cartels and the fentanyl epidemic. DEA Administrator Anne Milgram acknowledged that the government remained too focused on heroin at the onset of the crisis, as Mexican traffickers ramped up production of synthetic opioids.

“It is a new, deeper, more deadly threat than we have ever seen, and I don’t think that the full extent of that harm was immediately seen in 2015,” she said.

Narcotics agents say street-level demand for fentanyl is rising fast because so many new users are getting hooked. More than 9 million Americans “misused opioids” in 2020, according to the latest estimates by the Department of Health and Human Services. But the agency has not tracked the rise of fentanyl and does not know how many Americans are using it.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is unable to track overdose deaths in real-time. Its published data is one year behind, obscuring the picture of what is happening on the ground in 2022. The agency continues to count the death toll for 2021 — in a provisional tally seven months ago, it calculated the overall number of drug overdoses at 107,622. Two-thirds were due to fentanyl.

When President Richard M. Nixon launched America’s first war on drugs 51 years ago, annual overdose deaths stood at 6,771.  There is one federal system that collects both fatal and nonfatal overdose data in real-time in several regions of the country. But the system, called ODMAP, is kept from public view. A database launched by the drug czar’s office last week maps some nonfatal overdoses, which can highlight regions where deaths are likely to follow.

Without comprehensive data, the federal government is driving blind.

“This is like tracking the epidemic by visiting cemeteries,” said John P. Walters, who served as drug czar during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. “We’re not measuring what’s coming into the country in real-time. We’re not measuring what’s happening with the health consequences and where to put resources to buffer those health consequences. Our drug-control strategy is an embarrassment, and it doesn’t begin to propose a way of reversing this problem.”

The American fentanyl crisis deepened during the coronavirus pandemic. From 2019 to 2021, fatal overdoses surged 94 percent, and an estimated 196 Americans are now dying each day from the drug — the equivalent of a fully loaded Boeing 757-200 crashing and killing everyone on board. Ed Byrne knows better than anyone the cost of fentanyl on U.S. streets. Byrne, 54, a Homeland Security Investigations agent in San Diego, has kept his own count of the nearly 500 fatal overdoses he has witnessed. It was a way to impose some order on the snowballing disaster.

“It is so much useless death,” said Byrne, who began investigating fentanyl cases in 2018.

San Diego is ground zero for fentanyl trafficking into the United States. More than half of all the fentanyl seized along the southern border is confiscated there, much of it produced in clandestine drug labs and pressed into tablets by cartel networks in northern Mexico. Drug loads that cross the border undetected go to stash houses in Los Angeles and Phoenix before spreading eastward across the country. In Southern California, the cartels are renting Airbnbs to store drugs before shipping them across the country.

Byrne tracked fentanyl shipments as a key member of Team 10, a multiagency task force specializing in the drug. At death scenes, Byrne tested pills and powder and fingernails, a job that took him to $10 million mansions, rental apartments and homeless camps. Sometimes he went to suburban homes to find teenagers dead in their childhood bedrooms.

For all of Team 10’s success in catching dealers, the drugs and the overdoses kept coming. San Diego County tallied 92 fentanyl-related deaths in 2018, the year the task force was formed. Last year, there were 814.

Byrne and his colleagues printed hats and T-shirts with their own logo for Team 10: a lone wolf, howling into a void. The roots of the epidemic reach back to the Bush administration, which did little as countless Americans became addicted to oxycodone and other prescription opioids while U.S. drug manufacturers, distributors and chain pharmacies made billions in profits.

During the Obama administration, amid a wider questioning of the U.S. criminal justice system, the government defunded and dismantled key drug-monitoring programs in the years before fentanyl hit. President Barack Obama demoted the White House drug czar position, removing the role from the Cabinet. And when heroin use rose after the government crackdown on prescription opioids, authorities treated fentanyl as an additive, rather than a distinct threat requiring its own specific strategy. President Donald Trump took office just as the fentanyl epidemic was about to explode. He promised to build a wall along the U.S. southern border that he said would stop drugs. But Mexican traffickers were sneaking fentanyl right through the front door, hidden in passenger vehicles and commercial trucks passing through official ports of entry in California and Arizona. Today, the partisan border debate in Washington remains fixated on a physical structure that is virtually useless for stopping the deadliest drug U.S. agents have ever faced.

Since President Biden took office, his administration has amplified a public messaging campaign to warn about fentanyl’s mortal threat — “One Pill Can Kill.” He has stepped up efforts to improve scanning technology at border crossings and repair a broken counternarcotics partnership with Mexico. But with Republicans blaming Biden’s border policies for record numbers of immigration arrests, the president and many of his top officials have said little about the skyrocketing amount of fentanyl entering the country.  When the U.S. government cracked down on the U.S. opioid industry starting in 2005, it choked off street supplies of prescription narcotics but left behind a ravenous market. Mexican cartels filled it, first with crude heroin, then fentanyl. The cartels imported drugs and chemicals from China, hired chemists and purchased pill presses. But at the moment when the federal agencies responsible for preventing the drug from gaining a foothold in America were needed most, they fell short.


Overview: From Mexican labs to U.S. streets, a lethal pipeline

The amount of fentanyl seized along the U.S. southern border — the most reliable gauge of supply — has jumped ninefold during the past five years. Since July, border seizures of fentanyl have averaged 2,200 pounds a month, meaning U.S. authorities are confiscating more fentanyl in a single month than they did during all of 2018. Federal officials estimate they are capturing 5 to 10 percent of the fentanyl crossing from Mexico, but they acknowledge it could be less.

The drug is cheaper than ever because supplies are so abundant. On the streets of U.S. cities in the early 2000s, the most popular prescription pain pill was made by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, one of the nation’s oldest drug manufacturers. The company’s 30-milligram oxycodone tablets, known as “blues” or “M-30s,” sold for roughly $30 apiece on the black market. Today, fake M-30s made by Mexican cartels using fentanyl look identical but sell for $4 or $5 apiece on the streets of San Diego, and can be especially lethal to first-time users.  Byrne had been to 486 death scenes by the time his bosses decided he’d seen enough. They sent him this summer on a new assignment in the South Pacific. As he prepared to leave San Diego, the narcotics agents and prosecutors who worked with him threw a farewell party at the Tin Roof, a honky-tonk bar downtown in the city’s renovated Gaslamp Quarter.

“I can’t say we made progress,” said Sherri Walker Hobson, a tough, laser-focused former federal prosecutor who worked closely with Byrne, raising a toast to her best friend as the bar went quiet. “But we put up a good fight. We did the best we could to manage this.”

San Diego’s Gaslamp Quarter is lined with pricey new restaurants and old-style saloons that evoke the city’s history. They share the streets with thousands of people sleeping in tents and alleys, many gripped by addiction.

A few stood outside the Tin Roof, just beyond the sidewalk tables, on the night of Byrne’s farewell. At one point, a grubby, disheveled man with bulging eyes walked into the party and sat down among the cops. He didn’t speak, but he appeared to be under the influence of something powerful.

When one of the bartenders noticed and came onto the floor to confront him, the man ran to the back of the restaurant. Two of the plainclothes narcotics officers from Byrne’s party followed. They shooed the man out of the bar and back onto the street. ‘China, China, China’
By 2017, fentanyl had become the leading cause of overdose deaths in America. For three years, Hobson, then an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, had been tracking the steady rise in fentanyl seizures at the busiest land port in the nation — San Ysidro, 20 miles south of downtown San Diego. Fentanyl deaths had quadrupled in San Diego County between 2014 and 2017.

In the spring of 2017, Hobson formed the Fentanyl Working Group, a collection of federal and state drug agents, prosecutors and chemists, along with the medical examiner and other public health officials. It amounted to an emergency summit. Byrne joined the cause. They were hoping for a turnout of 15 people. Forty showed up.

The group began to collect drug overdose and seizure data and quickly realized that the doses of fentanyl that had been causing so many deaths in San Diego and across the country were coming from cartels in Mexico, not from traffickers in China.

“China was in the rearview mirror,” Hobson said. Hobson and her colleagues tried to spread the word. They launched a local public awareness campaign. They created fact sheets and PowerPoint presentations to alert law enforcement agencies in the region. Hobson traveled the country, speaking at national drug policy conferences, where she sounded the alarm about the flood of fentanyl coming from Mexico.

From 2016 to 2017, fentanyl seizures at California’s ports of entry rose by 266 percent, from 573 pounds to 2,099. Most involved counterfeit M-30 pills. At the time, 2.2 pounds of fentanyl cost about $40,000. That amount could be turned into 1 million pills, netting the cartels millions in profit.

Hobson knew how the cartels operated because she had been prosecuting methamphetamine cases since the 1990s. The San Diego region had been a hub for small-batch, U.S.-made “biker meth.” Then Mexican traffickers figured out how to cook it cheaper, and make it purer. They put competitors north of the border out of business.

“I think a lot of people underestimated the Mexican cartels,” Hobson, who retired in 2020 after 30 years with the U.S. attorney’s office in San Diego, said in a recent interview. “I knew they were very innovative. They weren’t hesitant to adapt and try new things.” Outside San Diego, Hobson’s warnings went largely unheeded.

The importation of fentanyl from Mexico was not the focus of the Trump administration. In October 2017, a Justice Department official said in an op-ed column that “most illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues come from China.”

The department announced an indictment against Chinese nationals, furthering the narrative that China was paramount. Reading through the indictment, Hobson realized that the allegations were old, dating back to 2014 and 2015. By 2017, it was clear to Hobson and members of the Fentanyl Working Group that the supply lines had shifted.

“There was so much focus on China, they didn’t look at where the ball was,” Hobson said. “They weren’t looking at the cartels in a serious way. It was all about China, China, China.”  ‘A game changer’
Byrne caught a case in 2017 that confirmed the lightning-fast rise of the Mexican cartels. On Aug. 11, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer stationed at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package from China containing a chemical called 4-ANPP, a precursor used to make fentanyl. Byrne and Hobson, along with agents from the DEA and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, devised a plan.

The team replaced the precursor with a bag of sand, put a tracking device on the package and followed it to San Diego. It was delivered to a post office box near the border linked to a man named Cesar Daleo. Byrne recognized the name from his days working as a U.S. Border Patrol agent before he joined Homeland Security Investigations. Daleo was once a Border Patrol agent, too.


Inside the daunting hunt for the ingredients of fentanyl and meth

The team members decided to allow Daleo to pick up the parcel. It would be the 14th time that he had signed for such a package since 2016. They hoped Daleo would take the interstate off-ramp from San Ysidro into Mexico. If he took the bait and drove onto the ramp, he would be making a commitment to entering Mexico. The team could then prove in court that the precursor chemicals were bound for the cartels.

On Aug. 29, 2017, Daleo picked up the parcel and opened the box, severing a hairline surveillance wire and sounding an alarm to the team. He tossed the box containing the bag of sand into his trunk and headed south, taking the off-ramp to Mexico. A Homeland Security tactical team cut him off. One of the agents tossed a stun grenade at Daleo’s car. He crashed into a guardrail. The agents smashed Daleo’s driver’s side window, dragged him through it onto the ramp and carted him off in handcuffs.  Daleo later pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 30 months in prison. For the first time, Byrne and Hobson had unassailable proof that the cartels were making their own fentanyl and cutting out the middlemen.

“It was a game changer,” Byrne said.

But in Washington, fentanyl was barely registering on the radar screen.

That year, the DEA published a 94-page resource document that devoted four pages to synthetic opioids. It made no mention that Mexican traffickers were producing fentanyl. Under “Drugs of Concern,” fentanyl was not listed. In the DEA’s 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, the agency devoted 10 of 169 pages to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. U.S. law enforcement agencies surveyed by the DEA identified heroin as the greatest threat facing the nation, followed by meth and prescription drugs. Fentanyl came in fourth, slightly ahead of marijuana.  There were other missteps. In the years before fentanyl hit the streets, crucial programs to monitor drug use were dismantled.

One, the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, gathered urine samples from recent offenders. The program, run by the White House drug czar, was scuttled in 2013 by budget cuts.

The Drug Abuse Warning Network, which collected drug use and overdose data from hospitals and emergency responders, was eliminated in 2011. The government brought back a version of the program in 2018, but by then, the fentanyl crisis was well underway.

“These programs, as imperfect as they were, at least gave us something. And they were defunded,” said Keith Humphreys, who served as a drug policy adviser to the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.  Soon after Trump became president, his administration proposed eliminating the drug czar’s office entirely. It became a backwater for political appointees, many of them with scant or no drug policy expertise. A 23-year-old Trump campaign worker was named deputy chief of staff, but no one had been nominated to head the office. Nearly nine months into his presidency, Trump selected Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) — a former federal prosecutor and one of Trump’s first and most strident supporters in Congress — to be drug czar. But Marino soon withdrew his nomination after it was revealed in a joint Washington Post-“60 Minutes” investigation that he had co-sponsored legislation that made it more difficult for the DEA to hold drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies accountable when they violated federal law.

As the Trump administration was preparing to leave the White House in 2021, the drug czar’s office issued its annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. The document is supposed to detail the government’s plan to reduce drug demand and disrupt supply chains. But the 2021 strategy document was nearly identical to the one issued in 2020. Many of its sections had simply been copied from the previous year.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/dea-fentanyl-failure/?itid=sf_world_article_list
1;Renewables to overtake coal as world’s top energy source by 2025, IEA says;"The world is set to add as much renewable energy in the next five years as it did in the past two decades, as a global energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine accelerates growth in renewables such as wind and solar, the International Energy Agency says.

Led by solar energy, renewables are poised to overtake coal as the largest source of electricity generation worldwide by early 2025, helping to keep alive the global goal of limiting Earth’s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), according to the Paris-based agency’s latest forecasts.

“Energy security concerns caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have motivated countries to increasingly turn to renewables such as solar and wind to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels,” the IEA said in a report on renewable energy published this month.

We looked at 1,200 possibilities for the planet’s future. These are our best hope.

Global renewable power capacity is now expected to grow by 2,400 gigawatts between 2022 and 2027, an amount equivalent to the entire power capacity of China today, according to the IEA report, the latest on the renewables sector. Global solar capacity is set to almost triple over the next five years, surpassing coal and becoming the largest source of power capacity in the world, the IEA said.

The capacity increase forecast in the report is 30 percent higher than the renewables growth the IEA was predicting only a year ago. More than 90 percent of global electricity expansion will be from renewable sources in the next five years, the IEA said.

“Renewables were already expanding quickly, but the global energy crisis has kicked them into an extraordinary new phase of even faster growth,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a news release.

The IEA described the war in Ukraine as a “decisive moment” for renewables in Europe, where governments and businesses are looking to rapidly replace Russian gas with alternatives. In the wake of the conflict, Germany — already a leader in renewable technologies but reliant on Russia for the bulk of its oil, natural gas and coal — brought forward its goal of 100 percent renewable power by more than a decade to 2035.

The IEA said Europe could roll out wind and solar even faster if European Union members agree to measures including streamlining and reducing permitting timelines, improving auction designs and providing better visibility on auction schedules, as well as improving incentives to support rooftop solar.

Outside Europe, growth in renewables is being driven by China, the United States and India — all of which are introducing regulatory and market overhauls faster than anticipated to combat the energy crisis. China is expected to account for almost half of new global renewable power capacity over the next five years, under a blueprint released in June as part of its five-year plan.

As Congress funds high-tech climate solutions, it also bets on a low-tech one: Nature

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has provided new support. The act, passed in August, includes $369 billion in climate- and energy-related funding — much of it aimed at high-tech solutions to help nudge the world’s biggest historical emitter toward a greener future.

“The current energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy system,” Birol said. “Renewables’ continued acceleration is critical to help keep the door open to limiting global warming” to 1.5 degrees Celsius.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/renewables-coal-energy-crisis-iea-2022/
1;Ukrainian politician who idolizes Reagan tries to win over today’s Republicans;"KYIV, Ukraine — The seven-foot-tall bronze statue of Ronald Reagan bursting through the Berlin Wall was supposed to be here by now, standing in one of the Ukrainian capital’s prominent public squares.

The monument was the brainchild of Maryan Zablotskyy, who grew up venerating Reagan in Lviv in western Ukraine — as many did in the post-Soviet years. Zablotskyy founded the Ayn Rand Center Ukraine to promote the libertarian author and covered his office walls with posters of Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill, with their quotes translated into Ukrainian.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Now a member of his country’s parliament, Zablotskyy, 37, faces the prospect that the party of his favorite politician could turn against Ukraine in its moment of greatest need — under invasion and relentless bombing by Russia, with about one-fifth of its land occupied and its economy in tatters. In Washington, congressional Republicans, who are about to take control of the House, have vowed to bring more scrutiny to the Biden administration’s requests for aid to Ukraine. Some have voiced skepticism about continuing assistance to Ukraine; others may obstruct the aid packages as part of a broader effort to thwart President Biden’s agenda ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Mainstream Republicans back Marjorie Taylor Greene audit of Ukraine aid

On Monday afternoon, Zablotskyy stood by the 164-foot Arch of Freedom in Kyiv’s Pecherskyi district, initially built in 1982 to symbolize the strength of the ties between Ukraine and Russia and called the People’s Friendship Arch. Earlier this year, Ukrainian officials renamed the monument to strip it of its Soviet past, and the Reagan statue will be placed here after the war ends.

“What I can do is explain that Ukraine is important to the whole world, and that we fight for values and ideals that should be equally important to both parties,” Zablotskyy said in an interview. After Republicans won a slim House majority in the midterm elections, many of the right’s most powerful advocacy groups released a memo urging Congress “not to rush” through Biden’s proposed Ukraine aid package, even as Ukraine’s leaders clamor for immediate help.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson has lambasted Biden’s support for Ukraine, and former president Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced admiration or warm feelings toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. Other Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have pledged staunch support for Ukraine.

Amid these divisions, some House Republican leaders are considering demanding that Biden agree to GOP-backed spending cuts in exchange for Ukraine funding, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to congressional Republicans.  That could complicate the aid packages by tying them to policy changes — such as reversing Biden’s plan to spend more on clean energy — that Democrats will reject. The White House is hoping to win approval of its latest request for $38 billion in aid for Ukraine before Republicans take control of the House in January.

“It’s a very contentious issue inside the caucus right now,” Moore said. “Everything is going to have to be paid for from here on out, and that will be a big fight because Democrats won’t want to have to cut domestic programs for aid to Ukraine.”

Inside the growing Republican fissure on Ukraine aid

Conservatives in the United States who support Ukraine say they see Zablotskyy as almost uniquely suited for making Kyiv’s case to the new House Republican majority.

For more than a year, Zablotskyy has made presentations once every other week at “the Wednesday meeting,” a coalition of leading conservative organizations led by Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, an anti-tax organization. Zablotskyy has spoken to more than a dozen lawmakers and has close ties with conservative think tanks and advocacy groups such as the Atlas Network.  In November, Zablotskyy launched a program with the Republican mayor of Miami to send weapons confiscated by U.S. police to Ukrainian citizens — part of his goal of bringing America’s Second Amendment culture to Ukraine. He secured $100,000 worth of donations last month from two conservative gun rights donors to purchase firearms for Ukraine, as well as a donation of 150,000 bullets. (Zablotskyy declined to name the donors, saying they want to remain anonymous.)

As a boy, Zablotskyy watched his parents carry their blue-and-yellow flags to street protests in 1990, as the Soviet Union’s collapse gave Ukraine its independence. He was too young to remember Reagan’s presidency, but he learned of the politician as a child and came to revere him.

“Maryan can speak directly to the commitment for freedom in Ukraine that resonates with those who believe in Ronald Reagan’s worldview,” Norquist said in an interview. “This is really the person who has met regularly with the broad center-right movement.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, another famous actor turned politician, partially “modeled his political image on Ronald Reagan,” according to Andriy Gerus, chairman of the energy committee in Ukraine’s parliament. In his inaugural address in 2019, Zelensky quoted Reagan saying “government is the problem.”

Support slipping for indefinite U.S. aid to Ukraine, poll finds

But Zablotskyy’s affinity for American conservatism is not shared universally in Ukraine. Many Ukrainian politicians hope to align their country with the moderate democracies of the European Union, which they plan to join, and have little affinity for Republican ideas on guns, economics or other policy questions, said Nazar Zabolotnyi, an analyst at Centre of United Actions, a Ukrainian nonprofit group dedicated to nonpartisan policy analysis.

“Ronald Reagan is a role model for many Ukrainians, but I think it’s more about understanding the danger of Russia and not so much Reagan’s ideology,” Zabolotnyi said. “You don’t find a lot of people here who will say to you, ‘I’m a Reagan supporter.’” GOP voters, for their part, seem increasingly lukewarm about Ukraine. About 50 percent of Republicans supported giving economic aid to Ukraine in a survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs last month, down from 64 percent in July and 74 percent in March.  A Wall Street Journal poll released in November found that about 48 percent of Republican voters believe the United States is doing too much to assist Ukraine, an increase from just 6 percent in March.

David Arakhamia, a friend of Zablotskyy’s who serves as a leader in Ukraine’s parliament, said he believes Republicans will support Ukraine but pointed to comments by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) — who is aiming to become House speaker after Republicans take control of the chamber in January — about rejecting “blank checks” for Ukraine as a cause for concern.

“They are worried about the Trump-wing rhetoric — ‘no more blank checks,’ all this stuff about weapons on the black market,” Arakhamia said, alluding to allegations in conservative media that U.S.-provided weapons to Ukraine have gone missing. “People are getting worried because it can really dramatically affect the war scene.”

Zablotskyy remains confident that the U.S. party he identifies with will ultimately deliver for Ukraine. But, he noted, Ukrainians need to make clear that they do not take U.S. support for granted. “We have to do our part to show how much we appreciate it,” he said.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/maryan-zablotskyy-ukraine-republicans-support/
1;Qatar’s foreign minister: This is ‘the most inclusive World Cup’;"DOHA, Qatar — Toward the end of last week, before leaving the Qatari capital, Today’s WorldView sat down with the country’s top diplomat. In the minds of many critics, especially in the West, Qatar’s World Cup will always be a tournament shrouded in controversy. Allegations of labor abuses and shoddy support for human rights have followed Qatar ever since it won the bid in 2010 to host the event. Rights groups and journalists tried to count the dead as hundreds of thousands of migrant workers were enlisted in a mammoth nationwide construction project.

But Qatar’s foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, wants people to take another view. He pointed to the joyous scenes of fans celebrating together in Doha, the happy regional vibes fostered by the Middle East’s World Cup, and the genuine labor reforms pushed through by the Qatari government over the past decade. A portion of our Thursday evening conversation with the foreign minister appears here. It has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Today’s WorldView: The World Cup began amid a lot of criticism and acrimony. Now that we’re nearing the last week of the tournament, how do you feel about where things stand?

Al-Thani: We believe that we are subject to something unprecedented. Some previous World Cups have been attacked or not especially praised. But this situation, especially given the long period since the award [of the World Cup bid to Qatar in 2010] and also the attitude and the behavior of some media toward Qatar was quite negative and disappointing from our perspective. They were trying to judge Qatar not based on facts, or not based on coming here and fact-checking.

We believe that this is the most inclusive World Cup. There are a lot of people from different countries, from different backgrounds who have never been able to come and enjoy the World Cup. If you look at the demography of the fans, Indian fans are there, fans from Pakistan, from Southeast Asia, from the Far East, from the Arab region, from Europe, from Latin America, from Central Asia. All of them, they are coming here and enjoying the football. Think about the uniqueness of this tournament in a very small country the size of Connecticut. People can go and attend four games in one day. And this made the World Cup affordable for a lot of people who never dreamed about coming to football, let alone attending multiple matches.

Honestly, the best reward for us in Qatar is the way the fans have enjoyed this tournament. We are seeing, whether on social media or in some media outlets that are trying to report impartially, most of the visitors are having a very positive experience. I am sure there are maybe some negative observations here or there. But most of them are talking about how hospitable this country is and the people of this country are. How kind they are. And this is something that we are proud of. We want to show to the world that Arab countries, the Middle Eastern region, are not only about wars and conflicts. It’s also about celebration and celebration of this beautiful game.

There is, of course, substance to the criticism. Surely you recognize the concerns that many outside Qatar have about worker rights and abuses that potentially surrounded the World Cup?  We never claim that our country is perfect. We never claimed that the conditions of the migrant laborers are perfect. Once these concerns were highlighted, Qatar has acknowledged them and taken them seriously. All the reforms throughout the last 12 years that Qatar took on have been implemented. It’s been pictured in a way that Qatar is just ignoring the fact that there is an issue, which is not the case.

In fact, since the past eight years, we brought a group of independent lawyers to examine our labor situation and to identify for us the gaps and loopholes, whether in our legislation or in the system that we have here. And we took the report very seriously. We had 120 recommendations at that time. A lot of these recommendations were to be dealt with at the source countries of the migrant laborers. And part of it was the responsibility of the government of Qatar.

We opened our doors for the NGOs. There is no country in the region that adopts an open-door policy, like what Qatar did. Organizations like Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International, they can come here, they can publish their reports here. They cannot do it in some other places.  We set an example in this region, leading change, leading reforms. And unfortunately, despite all of this, some NGOs and media outlets were just trying to attack Qatar without acknowledging or appreciating all these developments that happened. It’s an achievement for a government system to change in 10 years. Europe didn’t change in 10 years. The United States didn’t change in 10 years. We have accelerated these changes. And we are also thankful for the World Cup that helped us in accelerating these kinds of changes.

But [critics] have been always pointing at the governments and the government’s responsibility. They never point at the companies. If there was a situation happening in Europe with migrant laborers being exploited, they would blame the company involved, never the government.  Families of migrant workers who died in Qatar are waiting for answers

Part of the scrutiny has come from a sense of confusion about statistics. For migrant worker death tolls, we are given data by the Supreme Committee (the Qatari agency created to run the World Cup) that doesn’t seem to reflect the full picture in Qatar. If you look at our statistics, we have the death rates published every year. It’s based on nationality. We don’t categorize by jobs. But this is the classification that we’ve been using. And this is a department that’s been established only a few years ago. We cannot expect from them to have an expertise and publish everything with all the details. And this is a journey that will need time.

With the Supreme Committee … they are publishing their data. Considering the workers who died in World Cup sites, one death is too many. But for the entire period [of preparation for the World Cup], there were three [deaths]. And this is what has been said and repeated many times.

But [our critics] don’t want to listen to the other side. That’s our problem. … There is a consistency in just attacking the country.  You spoke earlier of inclusion at the World Cup. But there has been a lot of questions around the ability of LGBTQ people and those who support them to participate here in Qatar.

We’ve been saying repeatedly, “everybody is welcome.” What we’ve been asking is for the visitors who are visiting us to come here to enjoy the football, focus on the football, enjoy our culture, enjoy the country and the hospitality of the country. Just respect the laws, which is something that is expected of Qataris when they are traveling in other countries. Respect our laws and our traditions.

We’ve been very clear: It’s not our business what is the background of the people who are coming. Our business is whatever … is affecting the public safety or trying by any means to offend the public. This is not acceptable. And this is applied to a LGBT couple or to a man and woman. It’s not something that’s pointed or directed toward one orientation or another. We’ve been saying that public display of affection is not allowed in Qatar. And this is applied to everyone. The issue is about public display of symbols, not affection. Why were people with rainbow flags stopped at stadiums?

Whatever is happening on the pitch, this is FIFA rules, not Qatar rules. Whatever is happening outside the pitch is our rules.

What should LGBTQ soccer fans expect at the Qatar World Cup? A guide.

What will the legacy of this World Cup be for your country and this region?

The World Cup is just a start. It’s not the end of the story. First of all, we’ve delivered something historic — having all these people coming here and experiencing the Middle East. We are 100 percent certain that it will help a lot in changing the perception of a lot of people around the world about the region. Second, all this infrastructure Qatar had planned back even before the bid, as part of our National Vision 2030. And the World Cup helped in accelerating this to be delivered and to be achieved. It’s going to continue to serve this vision for economic diversification and for our tourism sector continuing to flourish. Have you been struck by the Pan-Arab solidarity on show in Qatar and across the region in support of Morocco, in particular, as it makes its historic run?

This is something that makes us very proud, that Qatar, this small country, was able to bring all the Arabs back together. And this is the beauty and the magic of the game itself, how it brings people from different backgrounds, Arabs and non-Arabs, everyone from everywhere, together. You can never see this happening in the West, but you see it happen here because there’s a common denominator bringing us all together — we believe that all of us belong to each other. What you have seen here in Qatar, the way that the people and the fans blended together, it’s really something fascinating that I don’t think that we have ever seen before. And maybe we will never be able to see it again. On the sidelines of the tournament, we’ve seen major meetings between your emir and leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Is the World Cup a turning point for your country after the long boycott and blockade it experienced at the hands of some of your neighbors?

Given the crisis that we’ve been through, we believe that what should bring us together is much more important than what should separate us. We believe in the unity of the [Gulf Cooperation Council, a bloc of six Arab monarchies in the region]. This doesn’t mean that we will agree on everything. We have differences. Let us build on what we have as a common objective. We cannot restore everything. We know that will take time. But we see a leadership willingness to bring back the relationship where it should be.

We also understand that we are connected, despite disagreements in some policies, that … it’s better to elevate ourselves above our differences and focus on the challenges that come. We see the world is polarizing. We see the impact of the Russian war with Ukraine. We see the impact of covid. And we see that all these global crises that are happening around us is affecting us either directly or indirectly. And if we are not going to work together building our integrated systems and integrated resilience, we will never be able to survive such challenges.

There is a perception that part of what provoked the dispute is Qatar’s independent streak in foreign policy and its support over the years for certain actors, specifically political Islamist parties like the Muslim Brotherhood. Is that a fair perception?

The first half of the perception is the truth: We agree on some policies and we disagree on some policies, given our assessments and given their assessment. What we’ve been saying that whatever we agree on, let us work together — and whatever we disagree on, let us agree that we disagree. And we respect this disagreement.

But there is this misperception, which is the second half of the question, that Qatar is picking actors in the region to stand for something. This was never the case for Qatar. We are not taking the side of political Islam or the side of liberal parties versus secular parties. It’s not our business. We are a state. We are not a political party.

Maybe we took certain steps, certain policies when the Arab Spring started [to back elements of pro-democracy uprisings in parts of the Arab world in 2011]. But those steps were not taken until we have seen the people of those countries either bombed or victim to massacres. That is when we acted collectively, maybe not with the GCC, but with other countries.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/12/qatar-world-cup-controversy-human-rights-interview-foreign-minister/ 
1;"Ukraine live briefing: Deadly strikes in occupied Melitopol; Russian negotiators treated Whelan ‘very separately, very distinctly’";"Ukrainian and Russian-backed officials reported deadly attacks in the occupied city of Melitopol on Saturday night, both saying that a recreational center was struck and that there were deaths and injuries. The pro-Moscow officials blamed Ukraine, though Kyiv has not taken responsibility.

Meanwhile, fallout from the prisoner swap of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for WNBA star Brittney Griner continues. Some conservatives were angry that American negotiators couldn’t land a deal for Paul Whelan, the Marine turned corporate security executive serving a 16-year sentence in a Russian prison on espionage charges. John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that the Russian negotiators are “treating Paul very separately, very distinctly because of these sham espionage charges they levied against him. And then it kind of came together last week in the end game with just a Bout-for-Griner deal.”

Former president Donald Trump on Sunday said on Truth Social that he turned down a deal to release Whelan in exchange for Bout during his time in the White House. “I wouldn’t have made the deal for a hundred people in exchange for someone that has killed untold numbers of people with his arms deals,” Trump said. “I would have gotten Paul out, however, just as I did with a record number of other hostages. The deal for Griner is crazy and bad.”  Bout told Russian state media he “wholeheartedly” supports the war in Ukraine and would volunteer for the effort if he could. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said negotiations over the prisoner swap did not thaw U.S.-Russian relations.

Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.

1. Key developments
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by phone with President Biden on Saturday, according to Zelensky’s office. Zelensky thanked Biden for the defense and financial assistance the United States provides to Ukraine. “This not only helps succeed on the battlefield, but also maintains the stability of the Ukrainian economy,” Zelensky said in a statement posted to his Telegram channel. “We also appreciate the help that the U.S. provides to restore Ukraine’s energy system. I count on deepening cooperation in this area.” U.S. officials announced in late November a total package of $53 million to support energy infrastructure to strengthen the stability of Ukraine’s energy grid in the wake of Russia’s targeted attacks.
Ukraine deployed HIMARS rockets in Melitopol, Russian-installed officials said on Telegram, with regional governor Yevgeny Balitsky adding that the recreation center they hit was “destroyed” and civilians were eating dinner there. The Washington Post could not independently verify the claims. The United States has throughout the war supplied Ukraine with multiple High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, which are capable of striking precise targets from up to 50 miles away and have wreaked havoc on command posts and logistical hubs behind Russian lines.
Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials reported different death tolls in the Melitopol strikes, with Balitsky claiming two deaths and more than 10 injuries. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, said 200 people were killed or injured. The Post could not independently verify the figures, but such tolls have often been inflated by Ukraine and undercounted by Russia in the war.
Ukraine’s biggest rock star, who has been described as the country’s Bruce Springsteen, showed support for Melitopol. Sviatoslav Vakarchuk posted a selfie on Instagram of him wearing a shirt that said, “Melitopol is Ukraine!” to his 342,000 followers. Fedorov thanked Vakarchuk on Telegram.  “Nobody’s doing backflips … about the fact that Mr. Bout is a free man six years earlier than he would have been. But we’re going to protect our national security,” Kirby said on ABC’s “This Week.” In response to detractors of the deal, Kirby said: “They weren’t in the room. They weren’t on the phone. They weren’t watching the incredible effort and determination … to try to get both Paul and Brittney out together. I mean, in a negotiation, you do what you can. You do as much as you can. You push and you push and you push. And we did.” American negotiators have learned a lot about Russia’s expectations, Kirby said, and they’ll continue to seek Whelan’s return.
Russian shelling of a residential neighborhood in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region killed two people, regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said in a Telegram post. He said Saturday’s attacks targeted a hospital, cafe, infrastructure facility and residential buildings, and also injured five other people.
Utility workers in the Black Sea port city of Odessa are working to restore power and water supplies to residents after the city’s civilian infrastructure was targeted overnight Friday. City officials warned Sunday afternoon that 43 of the city’s 140 boiler houses were not working and that water was being delivered by car to streets without running supplies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed the blackouts, which at one point affected 1.5 million people, on Iranian drones being used by Russia.
Both Zelensky and Putin spoke on the phone Sunday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Reuters reported that Erdogan and Putin discussed a deal to secure grain exports from Ukraine and Russia — a lack of grain from two of the world’s largest producers could mean famine, especially in Africa and the Middle East. Zelensky posted on Telegram that his chat with Erdogan also revolved around grain. Ankara has continued to play a unique role as a NATO member, supplying Ukraine while also negotiating a grain deal that would benefit Kyiv and Moscow.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal posted on Facebook that, following eight waves of missiles, attacks have left 40 percent of the country’s high-voltage energy networks damaged to varying degrees. He added that all thermal and hydroelectric plants were damaged.
2. Battleground updates
Russia is allocating 30 percent of its annual government budget to military spending, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Sunday, describing it as a “significant increase” from previous years and a figure that could put pressure on other areas of spending. The ministry said Moscow’s federal budget for 2023, which was signed into law by Putin on Dec. 5, was also likely based on overly optimistic revenue projections.
Moscow is boosting its weapons production, former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said Sunday on Telegram, claiming that it was to face off supposed threats from North America, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. “We are increasing production of the most powerful means of destruction,” he said, “including those based on new principles.”
It will take 10 years to adequately rebuild the Luhansk region, said regional governor Serhiy Haidai, according to the Luhansk military administration Telegram account. Attacks continued in Bakhmut, which Zelensky on Friday said was “destroyed.” The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine posted Sunday on Facebook that 26 settlements throughout Bakhmut and Avdiivka were still experiencing attacks from tanks and artillery. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine posted on Telegram a photo of a burned-out vehicle it claimed was a 47th State Emergency Unit van trying to deliver aid to people in Bakhmut. That unit on Saturday helped extinguish a 300-square-meter fire caused by shelling, according to a Telegram post from Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. The blaze struck the top three floors of a nine-floor apartment building. No information was provided about injuries or deaths, according to the post.
Germany on Saturday said it has provided $21 million worth of generators to Ukraine, some of which will go to Odessa to help keep power on as Russian-backed troops target Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure. A local energy agency predicted it could take up to three months for the city to recover from the latest strikes. Norway announced a $100 million aid package the same day, which will be used to help repair Ukraine’s energy system, Zelensky said.
Stormy weather pushed in mines from the sea to the coast, officials warned Sunday. The Odessa City Council posted on Telegram that tides overnight deposited one of the explosive devices in the Mykolaiv region and another near Odessa. Demolition teams destroyed the mines to prevent uncontrolled damage, per the Telegram post. Even during winter, people spend time in the Black Sea, so defense forces along Ukraine’s southern border are warning people to be safe, the city council posted.

Bout said he wished Griner luck as they passed each other during their prisoner swap last Thursday. “I wished her good luck, she even extended her hand,” Bout, who is nicknamed the “Merchant of Death,” told Russian state-run television Saturday. Edited video clips of the pair shared by Russian state media does not appear to show the two conversing, and Griner has not commented on the alleged interaction.
“There is no inherent need for NATO to be drawn into a conflict,” British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in an interview with the BBC’s “Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg,” adding that the Western military alliance posed no threat to Russia. “Ultimately, it’s Vladimir Putin who issues the escalatory language,” he said. Cleverly’s remarks come after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned in an interview with Norway’s public broadcaster that the conflict in Ukraine could become “a major war” between NATO and Russia if things go wrong, and “we are working every day to avoid that.”
The Russian Embassy in London responded later Sunday saying it categorically denied Cleverly’s claims. “We are carefully recording all instances of London’s and other Western capitals’ involvement in the financial encouragement and arming of the Kiev regime, as well as in planning military actions against Russian facilities and military personnel,” the embassy said in a statement. “Naturally such criminal acts will have specific legal consequences for all those involved.”
A trio of human rights defenders in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were awarded the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony Saturday in Oslo: Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties (CCL), which is working to document alleged war crimes by Russian invaders; the Russian human rights group Memorial; and imprisoned Belarusian human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski. In her acceptance speech, Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of the CCL, urged foreign leaders to “stop making concessions to dictatorships.”
The Council of the European Union announced Saturday that it had reached a tentative agreement to lend 18 billion euros to Ukraine in 2023 to finance the war-torn nation’s immediate needs, such as rehabilitating critical infrastructure. The European Parliament will consider adopting the proposal next week.
Whelan’s brother hit back at former president Donald Trump for suggesting that the deal made to free Griner was “stupid” and “unpatriotic.” David Whelan told Fox News that Trump’s remarks were “disappointing” for a former president. “I think that what President Biden did was to take care of an American who was in peril and bring home the American that he could bring home,” he said.

Fierce claims to Crimea highlight slim chance of Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Ukraine’s hope of recapturing Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, long seemed like a far-fetched fantasy, but recent gains on the battlefield have suddenly made it seem possible, writes Francesca Ebel.

“Its return will mean the restoration of true peace,” Zelensky declared in October. “The Russian potential for aggression will be completely destroyed when the Ukrainian flag will be back in its rightful place — in the cities and villages of Crimea.”

Medvedev, the former Russian president, promised a “judgment day” in the event of an attack on Crimea, and a member of Russia’s parliament warned of a “final crushing blow.” Crimea has become a key part of Putin’s legacy, which would crumble if he loses the peninsula.

0;Ahead of shift to EVs, auto industry makes slow progress on efficiency;"American automakers are starting to reduce tailpipe emissions again after several years of stalled improvements in fuel efficiency, according to new federal data released Monday, a product of the Biden administration restoring rules eased by Trump officials.

10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint
U.S. passenger cars and light duty trucks are on course to get about 5% more efficient in the most recent model year, 2022, averaging more than 26 miles per gallon for the first time, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA released these estimates Monday as part of an annual report on the country’s auto fleet, a leading source of greenhouse-gas emissions.

The data shows the industry made very little progress on efficiency from model year 2016 through 2021, as cheap gasoline prices lured new buyers to purchase sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, making them the dominant choice for consumers. Nationwide fuel economy gained just 5% in that span, at a time when a deal with automakers originally struck during the Obama administration was supposed to require gains of more than 20%.  “It seems since the previous administration announced their intent to rollback … standards, automakers have basically done nothing,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumers Reports. “Policy is playing a role. If policy was driving automakers to do more, they would do more.”

Here’s how the electric vehicle revolution is going

Cars and trucks from model year 2021 — the most recent with complete data, according to the EPA — averaged 25.42 miles per gallon, up slightly from the 25.38 of model year 2020 and higher than the figure for model year 2016, 24.7.

At the behest of industry executives, the Trump administration had eased efficiency rules on passenger cars and trucks, saying changing consumer demands were making the old standards impractical. The Obama administration had made those rules — following rules first pushed by California — a cornerstone of its climate agenda, its primary response as the transportation sector become the country’s top source of emissions. Passenger cars and trucks alone accounted for 15% of all U.S. emissions in 2020, according to EPA data. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the lobbying group for automakers and suppliers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent years, the industry has been making a huge shift in manufacturing more electric vehicles, which have no tailpipe emissions and, according to the EPA, now regularly get the equivalent of more than 120 miles per gallon.

But it could be years before those changes produce major improvements, analysts said. EPA said sales of electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and fuel-cell vehicles are projected to reach 8% of production in model year 2022, up from 4% in the prior model year.

“With the transition to electric vehicles, there’s a lot less resources being put into better fuel efficiency than 10 years ago,” said Jessica Caldwell, lead analyst at Edmunds, a car-shopping support company. “Automakers have hit sort of the ceiling on the levers they can pull to get better fuel efficiency for gas-powered engines that aren’t hybrid or plug-ins.” Both the Biden administration and analysts said improvements estimated for model year 2022 are a sign that new rules are having an effect on the industry. The Biden administration last year effectively restored the Obama-era requirements starting for model year 2023. It requires 5% to 10% efficiency increases annually through 2026, up from the 1.5% annual requirements set under the Trump administration.

“Today’s report demonstrates the significant progress we’ve made to ensure clean air for all as automakers continue to innovate and utilize more advanced technologies to cut pollution,” the EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/12/12/cars-trucks-fuel-efficiency-climate/
0;U.S. charges FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with criminal fraud;"A trio of U.S. agencies filed a flurry of charges against disgraced cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, one day after he was arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. government.

Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.
Federal prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried, 30, with conspiracy and fraud, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that he defrauded his investors, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed fraud accusations as well.

Up until recently one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at $32 billion by its investors, FTX collapsed into bankruptcy in November, enraging the scores of clients who had thought their cryptocurrency holdings were safely stored on the company’s exchanges. FTX had established a veneer of legitimacy, winning investments from respected venture capital firms, paying to have its logo on shirts of Major League Baseball umpires, spending lavishly on Super Bowl ads and pouring money into political donations. But U.S. officials allege Bankman-Fried was actually perpetrating a massive, years-long fraud, using customer money to pay off debts incurred by his hedge fund Alameda Partners, invest in other companies and make donations. And now, it seems, much of the money is missing.

“This is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a press conference in New York on Tuesday. The alleged fraud destroyed “billions of dollars in customer value overnight,” he said.

For the past several weeks, Bankman-Fried has been hunkered down in his luxury apartment in Nassau, Bahamas, posting on social media and giving repeated media interviews where he said he made grave mistakes but didn’t knowingly commit any crimes. His arrest and the charges, coming within hours of each other, are a rapid acceleration in the ongoing story of FTX, which has gripped the cryptocurrency world since the once-well-respected company crumbled over a period of several days in November when it could not meet customer withdrawal demands.  Cryptocurrencies, which use complex math equations running on a decentralized network of computers to establish value without a central owner like a bank or nation, soared in value and popularity during the pandemic as speculative assets. As prices for crypto tokens and coins marched up, many people scored newfound fortunes. The total value of cryptocurrencies around the world hit $3 trillion in November 2021.

But in the past year, as rising interest rates, concerns about a potential recession and several high-profile crypto company collapses, prices for crypto assets have plummeted. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two most popular cryptocurrencies, are down around 65 percent since the beginning of the year.

FTX’s demise is by far the biggest to hit the crypto industry this year, and Bankman-Fried’s downfall as one of its chief protagonists has deepened scrutiny of the industry as a whole. “Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement when charges were announced. “The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.”

Bankman-Fried appeared Tuesday in Bahamas court, where he did not waive a right to an extradition hearing, according to local news reports. It’s unclear how long an extradition hearing will take, or what his chances are of fighting the deportation.

Mark Botnick, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried, said his client “is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options.”

While Bankman-Fried was in court in Nassau, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing focusing on FTX, which the former CEO was slated to attend via video call before his arrest. The hearing did however feature FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, a veteran bankruptcy lawyer who took over when the company declared bankruptcy to try to recover as many assets for customers and creditors as possible.

The alleged crimes at the heart of the crypto company’s collapse are simple, despite the seemingly complex nature of the circumstances, Ray told the hearing.

“This isn’t sophisticated whatsoever. This is just plain old embezzlement,” he said.

FTX customers will not get all their money back, and the process to recover what they can will take “months, not weeks,” he added. “At the end of the day, we’re not going to be able to recover all the losses here.” The hearing exhibited a sense of anticlimax, as politicians who had prepared to grill Bankman-Fried himself were stuck instead asking questions to the agreeable and polite Ray. “Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the committee, said in a statement Monday night.  Before his fall, Bankman-Fried had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to politicians, becoming the second-largest Democratic donor in the 2022 midterm elections and building a prominent position for himself in Washington.

A number of crypto champions on the financial services panel used their time during the hearing to argue that FTX was a singularly bad actor that should not taint the rest of the sector. “We have to separate out the bad actions of an individual from the good created by an industry and an innovation,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who is set to chair the committee next year, said in his opening statement.

But there were signs the company’s implosion is weighing on lawmakers’ views of the broader industry. “My patience with the crypto bulls is wearing thin,” Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) said toward the end of the four-hour session. “It’s been 14 years, and the American public has heard lots of promises but seen lots of Ponzi schemes. For crypto, it’s time to put up or shut up.” In the white-and-pink Magistrate’s Court in Nassau, Bahamas, Bankman-Fried appeared wearing a suit coat without a tie, according to the Nassau Guardian, a local newspaper. Members of Bankman-Fried’s family and representatives from the U.S. Embassy were present in the courtroom, according to the newspaper. Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried are both professors at Stanford University’s law school. The SEC alleges Bankman-Fried used funds that had been commingled with customer money to buy them real estate. A spokesperson for Bankman and Fried did not return a request for comment.

The saga is far from over.

The government’s indictment suggests that prosecutors will indict more people or may already be working one or several of Bankman-Fried’s associates to build their case against him, said Mark Kasten, a lawyer with Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney who has worked on cryptocurrency litigation.

“Conspiracy is not something you do alone,” Kasten said.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/13/sbf-sec-fraud-charges/
0;Hong Kong demands Google bury protest song in online anthem search results;"HONG KONG — U.S. tech giant Google is under increasing pressure by the Hong Kong government — and, by association, China — to bury in its search results a politically sensitive pro-democracy song that has been mistaken for the national anthem.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The move shows the rising tensions between multinational tech giants and Chinese authorities as Beijing seeks to hide any lingering dissent from the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that began in 2019.

The Hong Kong government’s renewed concern over the song came after at least two instances over the past few months where it was mistakenly used to represent Hong Kong athletes at sports matches.

The chance revival of a Hong Kong protest song has angered authorities

The appearance of the song at sports events abroad triggered angry reactions from Hong Kong authorities. On Monday, Chris Tang, the security minister, said the government will “make every effort to interdict such actions.”  On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee said that the government will continue to correspond and follow up with Google, and that it is “possible to rearrange the search results via advertisements and remove items” that have violated the law.

“Setting aside its legal status, the national anthem represents the dignity and feelings of a country and its people,” Lee said. “It’s a moral issue. I believe any responsible institution must take it seriously.”

Since Hong Kong’s handover from British rule to Beijing in 1997, Hong Kong’s official anthem has been the same as China’s — “March of the Volunteers.”

During the 2019 protests, however, demonstrators popularized the pro-democracy song, “Glory to Hong Kong,” which widely came to be seen as the “anthem” of the movement — apparently confusing Google’s search algorithms.

Millions marched in peaceful protests against an extradition bill that year, but increased violence amid a heavy-handed police response, and the protesters’ shifting goals, saw Beijing in 2020 impose a national security law that has been used to crack down on freedoms of protest, speech and academic research. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment but said its search results are determined by its algorithms. The company says it only removes content that violates its policies or are deemed illegal in different jurisdictions. The top results of an English search of “Hong Kong national anthem” on Google is the Wikipedia page for “Glory to Hong Kong” with text saying that some have dubbed it the “national anthem of Hong Kong.” The next result is the Wikipedia entry for “March of the Volunteers,” and the video offerings are clips of the pro-democracy song on YouTube.

Hong Kong’s once-vibrant movie industry now walks a fine China line

In November, a lawmaker staged a protest at Google’s Hong Kong office, delivering a letter at reception saying that as a big corporation, Google has a “responsibility” to delete the “song about Hong Kong independence.”

Several other members of Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing legislative council flagged the severity of the incident and demanded the government regularly inspect search results and inform the service providers to remove “inaccurate information involving national sovereignty.” The anger toward an international tech firm is out of character for Hong Kong, where access to information online remains largely free as opposed to that in the mainland, and such openness is part of its attraction for multinational companies.

In Dubai two weeks ago, the pro-democracy song was played and then cut short when the Hong Kong gold medal winner at a weightlifting competition alerted organizers. In November, an instrumental version of the song was played in full at an international rugby match featuring the Hong Kong team in Incheon, South Korea.

Hong Kong authorities immediately launched a police investigation and the chief secretary summoned the South Korea’s consul to tell him the government “strongly deplores and opposes the incident” and request an inquiry.

On Monday, the police arrested a 49-year-old man under a sedition law and accused him of sharing footage of the South Korea incident and expressing gratitude to Incheon for “recognizing the Hong Kong national anthem.”";https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/13/hong-kong-google-anthem-search/
0;Monkey deaths at Musk’s brain-implant firm stir calls for FDA bans;"A leading medical ethics advocacy group asked federal regulators Tuesday to disqualify data collected by Elon Musk’s Neuralink medical device company during animal tests, potentially stymieing the tech mogul’s aspirations to develop brain implants.

Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine wants the Food and Drug Administration to discipline Neuralink over charges that it violated “good laboratory practice” — a standard set of regulations that govern biological tests and data reporting — during invasive and gruesome tests on monkeys, sheep and pigs. It also requested that the FDA bar Neuralink from conducting additional animal trials.

Musk has said his company is months away from starting human trials and has begun submitting data to the FDA to gain regulatory approvals. Any sanctions from the agency could force Neuralink to begin the rigorous approval process anew. “When you submit your paperwork to FDA, you can’t start following good laboratory practices at that time. You need to have been following them for quite a while,” said Ryan Merkley, the Physicians Committee’s director of research advocacy. “And clearly, from our perspective based on public records and news reports, it’s hard for us to believe that Neuralink had been following good laboratory practices.”

Representatives from Neuralink, which is developing a brain implant to treat neurological ailments, did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk said last month that the company would have its first experimental human implant “probably in about six months.” During the presentation, he showed video of a macaque named Pager playing the video game “Pong.” Musk said a brain implant allowed Pager to play without a controller. Neuralink does “everything we possibly can” to test devices before implanting them in living creatures, Musk said at the time.

“We’re not cavalier in putting devices into animals,” he said. “We’re extremely careful. And we always want the device whenever we put the implant — whether it’s in a sheep or a pig or a monkey — to be confirmatory, not exploratory.”

The Physicians Committee obtained more than 700 pages of records from Neuralink’s tests on rhesus macaques, a frequently studied primate native to Asia, after a successful lawsuit against the federally funded California National Primate Research Center at the University of California-Davis, which conducted the experiments.

Those documents include surgical records for 22 monkeys. The Physicians Committee said two of those procedures represent severe violations of FDA regulations. In 2018, a day after a Neuralink surgeon operated on a female macaque, according to public records, veterinary officials who observed the animal suffering recommended euthanasia in line with ethical standards for the treatment of research animals involved in tests.

The surgeon used a surgical glue that was known to cause catastrophic side effects, and the animal was likely experiencing fatal consequences, veterinary officials said.

But the study director kept the animal alive for another 24 hours to observe the aftereffects, the documents show. In that time, the monkey repeatedly collapsed after retching and gasping for breath, and staff euthanized her shortly thereafter.

In 2019, a year after that procedure, another Neuralink surgery repeated the mistake, records show. A surgeon implanted electrodes and temperature probes into a male macaque’s brain, but filled a void between the implants with the same unapproved glue that was found in the earlier surgery to be “toxic to the adjacent tissues.” The adhesive’s own product safety information indicates a risk of “‘acute nerve injury’ when directly applied to phrenic nerves.” The 2019 surgery lasted 6? hours, records show, and concluded when the monkey was euthanized. That represented a deviation from standard operating procedures in the tests, the Physicians Committee argues, putting animal test subjects at risk of undue suffering and tainting any data submitted as part of a regulatory filing.

“In light of the incidents documented above, we urge FDA to investigate [good laboratory practice] violations by Neuralink to determine if its facilities should be disqualified, which is within the agency’s power,” the Physicians Committee wrote to the FDA. “Disqualification would exclude Neuralink studies from consideration in support of applications for research or marketing permits for products regulated by the agency.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Office of Inspector General has reportedly launched an animal-cruelty investigation into Neuralink, stemming from employee accusations that pressure from Musk to hastily conduct experiments led to barbaric veterinary surgeries and the killing of roughly 1,500 animals involved in tests since 2018. Reuters first reported the existence of the investigation.

Reuters’s report cites internal Neuralink emails that described certain surgeries as rushed “hack jobs” that “resulted in underprepared and overstressed staffers scrambling to meet deadlines and making last-minute changes before surgeries, raising risks to the animals.”

It describes a 2021 incident in which researchers attached implants of the wrong size in the heads of 25 pigs. In a separate incident, Reuters reported, staff accidentally implanted a Neuralink device on the wrong vertebrae of a pig, then repeated the mistake in a second surgery.

0;Twitter dissolves Trust and Safety Council;"Twitter on Monday night abruptly dissolved its Trust and Safety Council, the latest sign that Elon Musk is unraveling years of work and institutions created to make the social network safer and more civil.

Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.
Members of Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council received an email with the subject line, “Thank You,” that informed them the council was no longer “the best structure” to bring “external insights into our product and policy development work.”

The email dissolution arrived less than an hour before members of the council were expecting to meet with Twitter executives via Zoom to discuss recent developments, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans.

Dozens of civil rights leaders, academics and advocates from around the world had volunteered their time for years to help improve safety on the platform. “We are grateful for your engagement, advice and collaboration in recent years and wish you every success in the future,” said the email, which was simply signed “Twitter.”

In less than two months, Musk has undone years of investments in trust and safety at Twitter — dismissing key parts of the workforce and bringing back accounts that previously had been suspended. As the body unravels, Musk is tightening his grip on decisions about the future of content moderation at Twitter, with less input from outside experts.

The move is just throwing away “years of institutional memory that we on the council have brought” to the company, said one council member who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about harassment on the platform. “Getting external experts and advocates looking at your services makes you smarter.” The Trust and Safety Council unraveled after Musk himself had pitched the creation of a content moderation council that would have weighed in on key content moderation decisions, but later appeared to change his mind about introducing such a body.

Many members were already on the verge of resigning, said Larry Magid, chief executive of ConnectSafely, a Silicon Valley nonprofit that advises consumers about children’s internet use.

“By disbanding it, we got fired instead of quit,” he said. “Elon doesn’t want criticism, and he really doesn’t want the kind of advice he would very likely get from a safety advisory council, which would likely tell him to rehire some of the staff he got rid of, and reinstate some of the rules he got rid of, and turn the company in another direction from where he is turning it.” Twitter first formed the Trust and Safety Council in 2016, as social networks were coming under greater scrutiny for their role in amplifying hate, terrorism, child exploitation and other problematic content online. The council convened a wide range of civil society groups, think tanks — and even some of Silicon Valley’s biggest critics. Twitter executives would regularly brief the council on new products in development and policies.

The Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that promotes press freedom around the world, decried the dissolution of the council. “Safety online can mean survival offline,"" the group’s president, Jodie Ginsberg, said in a statement. “Today’s decision to dissolve the Trust and Safety Council is cause for grave concern, particularly as it is coupled with increasingly hostile statements by Twitter owner Elon Musk about journalists and the media.”

“I don’t understand the logic of doing this when many of these relationships were hard fought to develop,” said another member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the council’s dissolution. Twitter told Trust and Safety members that their “regional points of contact will remain the best people to contact to escalate concerns.” However, Twitter’s Trust and Safety and policy teams have been gutted by recent layoffs, as well as employee departures following an ultimatum from Musk. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which was a member of the council, will be “keeping a lookout for how they restructure,” said Gavin Portnoy, the center’s vice president.

“For the moment, we’ll continue to encourage reporting to the CyberTipline and hope to continue to have a seat at the table to address child safety on Twitter,” he said.

Last week, three members of the Trust and Safety Council resigned, warning that the “safety and wellbeing of Twitter’s users are on the decline.”

Musk responded to replies to their tweet announcing their resignation, writing, “It’s a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!” Jack Dorsey, the company’s former CEO, responded to Musk, calling the claim “false.” But Musk’s comment nonetheless prompted a wave of threats and harassment at the board members who left the council, as well as some who remained. The Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that was a member of the council and has received funding from tech companies, said in a statement that it was “dismayed by Twitter leadership’s irresponsible actions to spread misinformation about the Council, which have endangered Council members and eroded any semblance of trust in the company.”

Musk’s treatment of the board mirrored a wave of attacks that enveloped a former top executive at the company over the weekend.

Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, and his family were forced from their home after Elon Musk’s tweets misrepresented Roth’s academic writing about sexual activity and children. The online mob also sent threats to people Roth had replied to on Twitter, forcing some of Roth’s family and friends to delete their Twitter accounts, according to a person familiar with Roth’s situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about Roth’s safety. Musk’s followers also directed harassment at professors who reviewed the dissertation that Roth wrote in 2016, as well as at his graduate school, the University of Pennsylvania, the person said. The university did not respond to a request for comment.

As head of trust and safety at Twitter, Roth was involved in many of the platform’s decisions about what posts to remove and what accounts to suspend. His communications with other Twitter officials have been posted in recent days as part of what Musk calls the Twitter Files, a series of tweets by journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss.

Musk’s tweets to his tens of millions of followers have for years prompted his supporters to deluge the targets of his ire with online threats — famously, a participant in the rescue of a boys soccer team trapped in a cave in Thailand, whom Musk branded “pedo guy.” But now that Musk owns one of the most powerful social networks in the world and has gutted the company division that previously policed online harassment, the stakes are even higher. Musk tweets about Roth recalled the QAnon conspiracy movement, which claims incorrectly that Democratic Party leaders direct a child sex abuse network.

“Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services in his PhD thesis,” Musk tweeted Saturday, attaching a screenshot of Roth’s dissertation.

In the text, Roth suggested that services like the gay dating app Grindr should adopt safety strategies to accommodate teenagers using their platforms, rather than drive them out entirely. Musk also commented on a 2010 tweet in which Roth wrote, “Can high school students ever meaningfully consent to sex with their teachers?” Roth then linked to an article about a Washington State Supreme Court ruling about what age students can consent to having sex with their teachers. Musk’s critical comments about Roth are something of an about-face from his early days at the company, when Roth appeared to be one of the few high-level Twitter executives Musk supported. On Oct. 30, the billionaire tweeted, “I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs.”

And Roth appeared measured in his comments on Twitter’s new owner, seeking to reassure the public about company efforts to fight hate and protect elections. He even appeared alongside Musk in a call intended to reassure advertisers.

Even after he left Twitter in November, Roth was muted in his criticism. He warned in an op-ed in the New York Times that there was “little need” for a trust and safety function at a company where “policies are defined by edict.” But he also said publicly that it wasn’t accurate to depict Musk as the “villain of the story” in his takeover of the company.

“I think one of the things that is tricky about Elon, in particular, is that people really want him to be the villain of the story, and they want him to be unequivocally wrong and bad, and everything he says is duplicitous,” Roth said during an interview at the Knight Foundation conference. “I have to say ... that wasn’t my experience with him.”

Still, Roth is the most visible former Twitter executive assessing Musk’s actions, and his role at the company has been highlighted in the Twitter Files.

Twitter employees have long been wary of Musk’s ability to stoke online criticism. Shortly after he announced his plans to take over the company in April, he tweeted a meme to his tens of millions of followers with the face of Twitter’s top lawyer, Vijaya Gadde, that appeared to suggest the company’s decisions are affected by a “left wing bias.”

Twitter users quickly piled on — calling on Musk to fire Gadde or using racist language to describe her. Gadde was born in India and immigrated to the United States as a child. One user said she would “go down in history as an appalling person.”

Such harassment is part of a years-long pattern for Musk, with few legal consequences to date. Musk ultimately was not held liable in a defamation suit brought after he made his “pedo guy” remarks.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/12/musk-twitter-harass-yoel-roth/
0;Your phone is terrible at phone calls. Here’s how to fix it.;"If you want to scream because your phone calls sound like garbage, it’s not just you.

Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.
The voice quality you’re getting over cell networks on your $1,000 iPhone is generally worse than it was when the landline was the only phone that existed.

“There is a whole generation of mobile users that have never heard a high-quality voice call,” said Sue Rudd, who directs research on mobile networks for Strategy Analytics.

Maybe you’re thinking: Who cares about talking on the telephone?! In 2022?!?!?! You use your phone for everything but the phone.

Yeah, fine, the telephone call is losing relevance. But many of you still want or need to make calls.

And I want to stick up for the humble phone call as one of the most democratic forms of communication. You on your fancy Android phone can dial a landline for a business in Warsaw or ring a buddy with a budget smartphone in Melbourne, and it (probably) works. You don’t all need to use the same technology or pick the same app. The persistence of balky, scratchy or just not awesome-sounding smartphone calls is also a reminder that while we go gaga over artificial intelligence or the metaverse, we also can’t neglect older and boring technologies, like the phone call, that you use every day.

Let’s talk about three reasons mobile calls can sound awful, why you should care and what you can do about it.

Cellphone calling technology is complex.
You might be used to what cellphone calls sound like. But experts I talked to are attuned to what you’re missing and say you deserve better. They also say it’s a miracle that mobile phone calls work at all.

Tristan Huntington, vice president of product for the calling service TextNow, told me that audio apps including TextNow, WhatsApp and Zoom have a large measure of control over the steps to transmit your voice to your dad. The same was true in the landline age, when there was a dedicated circuit for each phone call. But in mobile calls, bits of your voice are passed from one tech middleman to another and are converted from one computer code to another, until those audio chunks reassemble into the other person’s ear. Some of the software used to transmit cell calls slices off chunks of your voice’s frequencies and squeezes sounds through the equivalent of a narrow tube. All of that tugging and smooshing can make your voice sound hollow or muddy.

Plus, we’re often on the move and phone calls have to work with a mishmash of old and new technologies. Basically, there are a zillion opportunities for things to go wrong with a cell call.

“It’s 100 years of stuff that somehow has to connect to each other,” Huntington said.

Smartphone companies cheap out on microphones and speakers.
Your smartphone takes a bunch of tiny electronic parts and crams them together into a space the size of a Hershey bar. It’s not exactly a recipe for perfect sound quality. Mobile network specialists also told me smartphone companies are prone to cut corners on the quality of microphones and speakers — what you need to hear and be heard.

I’m not saying we should bring back the old rotary telephone, but those things were perfectly designed to fit your ear holes and your face hole.

“The old handsets were designed to provide maximum conversational speech quality,” said John Beerends, an audio researcher with TNO, a scientific research organization in the Netherlands. “A mobile handset is not.”

You’ve moved past phone calls, which makes companies care less.
In the olden days, phone companies used to brag that you could “hear a pin drop” when you used their service. Not so long ago, smartphone reviews used to evaluate voice quality on new devices in addition to how good they were at taking photos. Not anymore. When you started making fewer phone calls, the companies involved focused more on improving how their phones and cell networks handled videos and Instagram scrolling. Phone call quality got pushed down the priority list, which made call quality stagnant, which made you care even less about the phone function of your phone.

Some of these technical limitations of voice calls are beyond your control. But you can try a few things that might fix or improve audio quality.

Use an app instead.
This is an easy suggestion, but I don’t love it.

Yes, modern apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, Signal and Zoom have technical advantages that make their audio quality better than a basic cellphone call. The companies also invest money to make sure you sound (and look) great.

The downside is that relying on chat apps forces you to use the same app as your calling partner(s), and that app is probably owned by some giant tech company. You’re also probably not going to contact the hiring manager about a new job over FaceTime. The phone call may be old and imperfect, but it’s ubiquitous.

WiFi calling is your friend. (But not always.)
If you do make mobile phone calls at home or somewhere else with a reliable WiFi connection, your call is often better routed over WiFi rather than over cellphone lines. Calls transmitted over the internet are often standard, depending on your smartphone model and cellphone provider. Search your phone settings for “WiFi calling” or a similar term, and turn on the option if it isn’t already. But in some crowded places like coffee shops, concert venues or airports, lots of people connecting to the same WiFi network can gum up the works. In those situations you might want to try turning off WiFi calling and routing a call over your 4G or 5G cellphone network.

And as silly as this advice sounds, if your phone call sounds terrible, try hanging up and dialing the number again.

Try using headphones or taking the phone out of its case.
If you’re connected to WiFi or can see full bars on your cellphone signal and still have bad phone calls consistently, the culprit may be the phone in your hand.

Ken Hyers, director of device technologies for Strategy Analytics, suggested using headphones when you make or receive calls. Even lower quality ear buds have microphones and software tuned to pick up your voice over cellphones. If you have a protective phone case, try removing it to see if that makes your audio call sound better. And hey, if you’re that guy using speakerphone while holding the phone an inch from your lips, that is not how the feature was intended to be used.

Hyers said if all else fails, a pricier phone will give you better call quality. “A thousand dollar phone is probably going to do a better job than a $200 phone,” he said.

5G will make things better — maybe?
Phone nerds are excited about a still-new technology for 5G phone networks called VoNR, or Voice over New Radio. (Mobile network jargon is out of control.) One of its promised benefits is a big step up in audio quality over older mobile technologies.

But for the voice improvements to kick in, device manufacturers, mobile phone providers and all the middlemen involved in bouncing voice calls around must use the same technology. That didn’t really happen in the 4G phone era and it’s probably not going to happen with 5G — at least not anytime soon. One tiny win
If you’re in the United States and traveling outside the country, the easiest option for most people — but definitely not the least expensive — is to buy international day passes available from AT&T and Verizon, if you get a monthly bill from one of those providers.

These passes, which typically cost $5 or $10 for each day you’re outside the country, let you use your smartphone mostly as you do at home and keep using your usual phone number.

My colleague Chris Velazco has other alternatives for how to keep your phone working while traveling abroad.

0;Bankman-Fried bought D.C. influence by spending ‘dirty money,’ prosecutors say;"Federal prosecutors charged Sam Bankman-Fried with multiple counts of fraud on Tuesday, just hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the disgraced FTX founder of orchestrating a scheme to defraud investors.

The indictments against Bankman-Fried accuse him moving billions of dollars illegally from FTX to Alameda. Prosecutors describe it as a “dirty money” scheme that helped fuel Bankman-Fried’s effort “to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington.”

Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee forged ahead with a hearing into the cryptocurrency exchange’s recent implosion despite the arrest Monday night of Bankman-Fried, its star witness, who was taken into custody in the Bahamas after U.S. officials requested his extradition. Lawmakers heard from John J. Ray III, who was brought in as FTX’s chief executive as Bankman-Fried stepped away from the company. Ray described the alleged crimes at the heart of the crypto company’s collapse as “plain old embezzlement” and said FTX customers will not fully recover their money.

Bankman-Fried is set to be arraigned Tuesday in the Bahamas.

0;Gen Z came to ‘slay.’ Their bosses don’t know what that means.;"When 24-year-old Mary Clare Wall read a message that said her colleague would be “out of pocket,” she and her young co-workers giggled.

As Generation Z workers, Wall and her peers interpreted the phrase to mean that their colleague planned to do something crazy or inappropriate, not that they would be unavailable. But in the same manner, she confused her older colleagues with her regular use of the word ‘slay.’

“I [had to] give an almost definition of the word ‘slay,’” she said. “Now they all text me ‘slay.’ They’re excited they know how to use it.”

Generation Z — defined by Pew Research Center as those born between 1997 and 2012 — is bringing its own style of communication to the workplace. As conversations have increasingly moved online to text-driven environments, Gen Z’s form of messaging is creating a quirky challenge for multigenerational workplaces: the potential for confusing, anxiety-inducing and sometimes comical miscommunication. Wall said using ‘slay,’ which to Generation Z means “good job” or “killing it,” is one of the many examples of how she and some of her older colleagues miscommunicate. Miscommunication also happens through uses of punctuation, phrases and emojis.

Cringe Quiz: Are you fluent in Gen-Z office speak?

The presence of Gen Z, called zoomers, in the workplace is only growing. By 2030 they are expected to more than triple to account for 30 percent of total employment in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to a study by Oxford Economics. For younger workers, that means being prepared for different interpretations of messages they send. And for older workers, that means getting comfortable asking questions.

“The trickiest thing is [language] keeps changing,” said Lieke Verheijen, an assistant professor who studies interpersonal and professional digital communication at Radboud University in the Netherlands. “This kind of misinterpretation can definitely complicate and hinder communication.”

Given that many zoomers grew up communicating digitally and through text, they’ve had to develop ways to incorporate tone and intention, said Verheijen. That means adding visual elements like memes and emojis and often using them ironically. And with their prolific use of social media, Gen Z workers are able to spread new trends to their peers much faster, leading to widespread adoption. To be sure, some of these slang were adopted from Black and LGBTQ+ communities.

Alyssa Velez, a 23-year-old media relations specialist in Chicago, said she had to adjust to seeing periods at the end of a sentence in Slack and email messages from her colleagues. Once she received a comment from a colleague saying “good job.” But the period made her second guess whether she was actually being praised.

“I’m like, ‘Is it a good job?’” she said. “It just makes me nervous. I even had to ask, and then I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m overthinking it.’” Janvi Kalra, a 23-year-old software engineer at San Francisco-based start-up Coda, agrees, noting that sometimes zoomers interpret periods as passive aggressive or cold because it’s so formal. But older colleagues prefer to use full sentences, complete with periods.

Kalra said often what causes the most confusion are emojis. She said a senior engineer once asked what she meant when she responded with a Slack reaction that coupled the fingernails emoji with a fire emoji on top (????).

“There’s the manicure emoji, and it means ‘Go on, queen,’” she said. “Then on our [Slack], there’s a fire on top so it’s double that.” Enough questions arise from the generational divide that Coda has a Slack channel dedicated to helping colleagues understand Gen Z’s emoji use at work. Kalra said some zoomers interpret the emoji with open eyes and puckered lips (??) as a face expressing judgment vs. a kissing face — an important distinction at the workplace. She and her peers also often use the skull emoji (??) or open-mouth emoji with streaming tears to convey exaggerated laughter (??) — as in dead from or crying of laughter.

But what about the generic smiley face that often appears in some apps after typing a colon and a closed parenthesis (??)? Some zoomers say this can come off as passive aggressive or cold.

“It looks dead in the eyes,” Kalra said. “It doesn’t seem warm.”

Keith Broni, editor in chief of online emoji encyclopedia and archive emojipedia.org, said Gen Z tends to use emojis with much more nuance and creativity than prior generations because they grew up using them. Often, that means emojis take on a literal meaning much less frequently than they do with older colleagues.

“Earnestness is cringe,” he said. “It seems a little more ironic or sardonic.” Molly Foulkes, a 25-year-old client manager at workplace and event software company Frameable, said she bookends the lips emoji with an eyeball on each side to convey a “deadpan look” or shock (??????) — something she picked up from TikTok. But her older colleagues also have habits that throw her off. One is when they send her a thumbs up in response to anything other than a yes-or-no question.

“It can be disheartening and sometimes annoying,” she said, adding that it can also cause confusion. “Are they following up? When should I?”

Stop Slacking me: How to set digital boundaries for chatty colleagues

Ellipses is another element that can create hesitation for some zoomers. Older generations tend to use … as a casual way to break up or to change the pacing of a story, Broni said.

But Wendy Monta?o, a 23-year-old technical support analyst for a Texas-based tech company, said she absolutely “hates” ellipses.

“If anyone ever uses dot, dot, dot, I just think, ‘Oh my God, I pissed them off,’” she said. “My brain automatically goes, ‘What did I say?’ or ‘Oh my God, was this annoying?’”

She and her peers are much more likely to include exclamation marks — something she notices older colleagues don’t use as often. For her, one or even consecutive marks helps express her enthusiasm.

Another common speed bump for zoomers? Big blocks of text in one message. For some, receiving a message from a colleague that has several requests or suggestions can feel starkly formal, a little overwhelming or possibly even confusing if there’s too much squished into one place, they said. Gen Z tends to separate their thoughts and questions into different messages, which also eliminates the need for capitalization and punctuation, Verheijen points out.

“Older generations adapted the idea of email from letter writing,” said Andrew High, a Penn State associate professor who studies interpersonal communication. “For Gen Z, letter writing was foreign. They were texting.”

High says that zoomers have been interacting and maintaining relationships online for a greater proportion of their lives than anyone else. This influences what they see as normal. For some zoomers, the immediacy of text messaging has also altered how quickly they expect to receive communication responses. Layla Wellington, a 22-year-old graduate assistant for the University of Illinois Springfield, said she had to acclimate to a delay in receiving responses to emails.

“With that gap, we can build emotion about why they aren’t responding,” she said, adding that she didn’t use email much before college. “I had to realize that it takes time and a lot of people like to reply in business hours.”

To mitigate potential misinterpretations, Wall, like several zoomers, said her solution is to “code switch” at work. So she’ll mimic her colleagues’ style and stick to well-known emoji use and phrases.

But Wall admits it’s even difficult for her to keep up with the latest trends and lingo. For example, her brother, who’s four years younger, only communicates via direct messages on Instagram.

“I’m trying to pay attention to my friends, but we’re not that cool,” she laughs. “It’s funny how trends get to kids younger than me faster.” ";https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/12/gen-z-work-emojis/
0;Emma Tucker to replace Matt Murray as editor of the Wall Street Journal;"The Wall Street Journal on Monday named Emma Tucker — a British journalist from the Sunday Times of London who is close with controlling shareholder Rupert Murdoch’s inner circle — as its new editor in chief, replacing Matt Murray, a Journal veteran who has led the paper for the past 4? years.

Tucker, 56, will be the first woman to serve as top editor of the Journal in its 133-year history. News Corp, which oversees Murdoch’s publishing empire, said Murray will take on a new executive role at the company, reporting to chief executive Robert Thomson after assisting Tucker through a one-month transition beginning Feb. 1.

The move signals a reassertion of control by Murdoch, who bought the Journal in 2007 and quickly took editorial command of the publication. Since then, Murray has been the only top editor to rise through the ranks of the Journal; the others have been editors brought over from other Murdoch titles. During Murray’s tenure, the Journal won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 2019 and produced significant series such as the “Facebook Files” and an investigation into the financial conflicts of interest among federal judges. Digital-only subscriptions to the Journal doubled, growing from approximately 1.6 million as of June 2018 to nearly 3.2 million as of the quarter ending in September.

His appointment to the top job in 2018, after nearly a quarter-century at the paper, quelled significant staff dissatisfaction with his predecessor Gerard Baker, a British journalist who among his various roles had previously written conservative commentary — describing himself as a “right-wing curmudgeon” — and who was perceived by many staffers as overly friendly toward President Donald Trump.

But Murray clashed occasionally with the paper’s publisher, Almar Latour, on the Journal’s long-term editorial strategy and efforts to increase subscribers, the New York Times reported last year.

Rupert Murdoch considers merger of two halves of his business empire

On Monday, Thomson praised Murray as a “superb journalist and leader who has overseen a peerless editorial team that fashioned success for the Journal during an era of extreme vulnerability for media companies and journalism.” Since January 2020, Tucker has served as editor of the Sunday Times, which she joined in 2007. She had previously worked alongside Thomson at the Financial Times, where he was an editor. Her candidacy for the Journal post also got a boost from Rebekah Brooks, who oversees News Corp.’s British arm, which includes the Times of London and the Sunday Times, as well as the Sun tabloid.

Under Tucker’s editorship, the Sunday Times was named Sunday Newspaper of the Year at the U.K. Press Awards and saw a more than 40 percent increase in digital subscriptions, to 450,000 by September 2022, up from 320,000 at the end of 2019.

Thomson praised Tucker as someone whose “global vision and experience will be particularly important at a time of immense international opportunity” for the Journal.

News Corp. said that the five-member Dow Jones Special Committee, created in 2007 to monitor editorial standards and ethics issues at the Wall Street Journal, had “unanimously approved” the appointments.

The move comes as the two companies under the Murdoch family’s control — News Corp. and Fox Corp. — are exploring a recombination. The entities split in 2012 after the phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch’s British tabloids.

Murdoch sold the vast majority of his empire to Disney in 2019 and named his oldest son, Lachlan, as CEO of Fox Corp.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/12/emma-tucker-replace-matt-murray-editor-wall-street-journal/
0;Is chaos cooking a pathway to inner peace? Many think so.;"Depending on her mood, Ethaney Lee is a chaotic cook.

A digital creator and home cook who posts about food on her Instagram @tenderherbs, Lee will often channel her emotions into dishes such as the pavlova she wrote about recently for the site Cup of Jo. To Lee, a simple pavlova’s snowy white peaks of whipped sugar and egg white offer a blank canvas for dramatic splashes of red and blue, the latter of which Lee achieves with butterfly pea extract.

Lee’s pavlova reflects a subtle but noticeable shift in the food world toward excess, strangeness and borderline recklessness. Bakers such as Julie Saha and Aimee France eschewed acetate collars and neatly piped rosettes for teetering, overdecorated cakes in a tangle of clashing colors at the recent Brooklyn event, “Chaotic Cakes, A Pop Up.” Deb Perelman of the popular recipe blog Smitten Kitchen talks about making a Strawberry Brita Cake because she “wanted berry cake chaos,” while plant-based chef Kate Ray describes her cooking style as “Punchy chaotic many-textured many-choices vegetable-remix food” in her newsletter, Soft Leaves, this past July. Jump to the recipe


Framed in this way, chaotic cooking openly subverts mainstream rules for how to cook and what tastes or looks good in a way that’s both playful and intelligent. To cook chaotically means to channel both the challenges and the possibilities of daily life into your meals, with the same goal of any passionate cook: making delicious food.

While I now readily embrace the idea of chaos in cooking, as someone living with chronic anxiety, I used to be so fearful of creating something inedible — and then having to literally eat my failure — that the thought of so much as swapping in light brown sugar for dark would push me to nearly break down before I’d even begun making my cookie dough.

With time, practice and plenty of therapy, I eventually started to ease up on myself. Life, I’ve learned, is chaotic: Occasional failure is inevitable. Why stress yourself out by fighting it? I’ve spoken with three cooks and writers — Allison Robicelli, Kate Ray and Ethaney Lee — each of whom regularly incorporate chaos into their cooking. Here, they’ve provided us with a few pieces of wisdom that can help the timid or overly regimented home cook take those first baby steps into the unknown — or at least into the shadowy depths of their own pantries.

Ease into it
To Ray, chaos is “something beyond boundaries.” She points to Lil’ Deb’s Oasis, a restaurant in Hudson, N.Y., that serves what the owners describe as “Tropical Comfort Food,” as a prime example of chaotic cooking. The owners, who come from Ecuadoran and American southern backgrounds, respectively, “talked about putting together their menu with a lot of lime and butter,” Ray said. “These are things that don’t [traditionally] go together, but [the owners] would find their taste together by stepping across these culinary boundaries.” You don’t have to open a restaurant to start cooking chaotically, however. To the chaos-shy home cook, Ray suggests starting with a dish you know intimately. That way, the stakes for experimenting are lower. Oatmeal or congee are two great options, as both have “a limitless number of combinations and directions.” Ray herself recently combined black sesame, ground ginger and dried cherries for a particularly warming bowl of oatmeal, she said.

Ray also offers an online workshop called “No Recipe,” which she described over email as “structured less like a traditional class and more like an improv workshop.” In it, cooks start with a template — such as vegetable fritters — and learn to gradually adjust for their own tastes, experimenting to see what works and what doesn’t work. The workshop was a reaction to traditional culinary classes, which Ray describes as more about “memorizing steps” than developing your own tastes.

Save experiments for downtime
Chaotic cooking is something that takes a bit of practice to get comfortable with, but there’s certainly a time and a place for trying it out. “I’m not doing any[thing] fun during the week,” said Robicelli, food writer and Post contributor. “That’s weekend stuff!”

Forcing yourself to experiment when you’re just not in the mood is a surefire way to suck the joy out of cooking — which, she emphasized, is not what cooking should be about. “We eat a lot of eggs,” she said of her family’s weekday suppers.

The same goes for being freewheeling when entertaining. “I would say, don’t attempt your experiments when you’re hosting a dinner party,” Ray said. “If you’re trying to impress other people, then you’ll be too worried about getting it right.”

Pay attention to your emotions: If you’re feeling weird, off-balance or irritable, it’s okay — maybe even therapeutic — to let that come through in your food, something Lee often finds herself doing. Lee struggles with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which is often accompanied by moodiness and irritability. “Often, during certain times of the month, I feel very off-kilter,” she said. “I find that that’s when I gravitate toward food that maybe is not the most natural-looking in terms of color,” hence the use of blue dye in the aforementioned pavlova.

Giving in to that urge feels cathartic, she said.

Aside from making strange or unnatural-looking food, another way to cook chaotically is by allowing yourself to be selfish once in a while. Lee, who also has a history of disordered eating, often finds it difficult to give in to her cravings without feeling some kind of guilt. One way she’s able to push past those feelings, she said, is by occasionally eating a meal that feels almost excessively indulgent — like a half-pound of pasta in a “luxurious” sauce, or thick-cut toast “slathered” with chocolate almond butter and peanut butter with flaky salt. “For me, that is chaotic.” she said. “Because I’m rebelling against what my own brain is telling me that I should be doing or what I should be eating.”

Accept chaos as a natural part of cooking — and life
Chaos is part and parcel of Robicelli’s approach to food writing, which often includes mess-forward, deeply creative recipes like Nutellasagna and Cherry-Bourbon Glazed Ribs.

“The word chaotic is painfully overused but I have no other adjective for @robicellis's approach to recipe development and I want to eat everything she writes about,” tweeted food writer Max Falkowitz in 2021.

Robicelli agreed with Falkowitz’s description. “I am the physical manifestation of chaos, so I don’t really get an option,” she said.

An important element of staying calm in the kitchen, Robicelli said, is accepting the chaos that already exists in cooking, and in our lives. Robicelli has two teenage sons, and, on top of that, is responsible for feeding a household of seven. “There’s not one pan that’s enough for that. So you end up cooking a lot of foods simultaneously,” she said. “And just by nature, that’s so frickin’ chaotic.” Acknowledging that inherent chaos will help you get used to it over time. “If you just expect it, it doesn’t feel like chaos anymore. It feels very normal.”

Want to dip your toe into a little chaos? Try Ray’s recipe template for vegetable fritters. It’s one she uses in her “No Recipe” workshops. No-Recipe Fritters
Chaotic cooking is about concentrating on what is happening to your food as it cooks and observing what it’s telling you, and fritters are one of the best ways to practice that.

This intuitive recipe template can be used for a variety of fritters, such as latkes and okonomiyaki. Start with chopped or sliced vegetables, add a starch for binding, an optional egg (which also helps with binding) and a little baking powder, which provides lightness and helps with browning.

Fritters are versatile and forgiving. And there’s a lot of room for correction along the way — if your first fritter falls apart, add more flour or egg to the batter and get it right on the second or third try. The hardest part is flipping them at just the right time. This is where it’ll help to use your nose, to smell if anything is burning, and your eyes, to see steam or observe whether the center looks cooked, and perhaps a little dexterity, if you want to pull up an edge and peek. You’ll have the best results if you follow these two rules:

1. Keep an eye on the heat, adjusting as you go.

2. Wait patiently until the first side is cooked before flipping them over.

To make your fritters, you can use some combination of the ingredients below.

You’ll want the mixture to be less liquid than cake batter, but less clumpy than cookie dough. You should be able to drop it from your spoon onto the pan and have it spread a little on its own (though you can help flatten it out with a spatula)

Baking powder (start with 1/2 teaspoon) ? Eggs (start with 1) ? Flaxseed eggs (grind some flaxseed and let it sit with a little water) ? Flour (all-purpose or whole-wheat or some other) ? Starch (potato, tapioca or corn) ? Grated Japanese sweet potato, such as nagaimo or yamaimo ? Grated taro ? Cooked rice or another grain ? Crumbled or grated cheese ? Cooked beans, smashed up a little

For the liquids
Water ? Stock ? Dashi ? Dried mushroom soaking water

For the flavorings
Minced aromatics, such as garlic, ginger, onions, shallots, scallions ? Spices such as black pepper, coriander, cumin, cayenne ? Minced fresh herbs such as minced cilantro, parsley, chives, rosemary ? A teaspoon or more of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce ? Salt (if you salted your vegetables to drain them of water, be careful not to add too much)

For the sauces
Yogurt or tahini mixed with salt, garlic, a little lemon, olive oil, and chopped fresh herbs, maybe water to loosen it. Consider:
Japanese mayo and okonomiyaki sauce/hoisin/plum sauce
Sour cream with fresh dill and a lot of minced garlic
Bean spread or hummus
Soy sauce with black vinegar, ginger, garlic and toasted sesame seeds
Basic marinara, made from blending canned tomatoes, garlic, salt and olive oil
Prep the veggies
Start by preparing the vegetables. Chop them small or shred them with a box grater or food processor. If they’re wet, you’ll want to toss them with salt, let them sit for 10 minutes, and then either wring them out in a clean dish towel, or press them in a colander. If you’re using greens, such as spinach or kale, cook them for about 30 seconds in boiling salted water, then squeeze them dry in a towel and chop them up.

Add flavorings and binders
Mix the vegetables with your chosen flavorings and a binder — an egg, a couple of tablespoons of flour and a little baking powder is a reliable combination. If you omit eggs, definitely use some baking powder.

Spoon in your liquids
Add your chosen liquid a spoonful at a time until you are able to drop the fritter batter from your spoon onto the pan. It should be less sticky than cookie dough, but thicker than cake batter. If you’re using flour, you may want to let the batter rest for 10 minutes after adding the liquid to let it hydrate.

Choose a sauce
Make your dipping sauce before you cook the fritters, if you want to eat them hot.

Fry your fritters
Heat a cast iron or nonstick skillet with oil (olive, coconut or neutral). Drop spoonfuls of the batter onto the pan, and use the back of a spoon to spread them to pancake shape. Watch them carefully and adjust the heat as needed. Flip them over when they start to crisp on one side and cook on the other side.

Troubleshooting: If your fritters aren’t spreading, add more water to the batter, 1 tablespoon at a time. If they’re falling apart when you try to flip them, add more flour and/or an egg to the batter.

Transfer the fritters to a paper-towel lined plate. Eat hot or at room temperature, or cold from the fridge the next day. Serve with a fried egg if you want.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/12/13/how-to-chaos-cooking/
0;How to store cheese: Tips to keep it fresh longer;"Putting out a cheese board is one of the easiest, most fun ways to entertain (or, in my case, have lunch). If you’re going to the effort of choosing and buying the good stuff, you want to make sure you keep it at peak quality before you serve it, as well as after if you happen to have any leftovers.

“All cheese is alive,” Anne Saxelby writes in “The New Rules of Cheese.” “Cheese is a fermented product that is constantly aging and changing, mostly for the better, and sometimes for the worse.”

How to build the ultimate cheese board

This process is why it’s so important to properly store your cheese, which will keep it from spoiling and ensure you can enjoy it while it's at its best. Here are some key points to keep in mind.

1
The best way to store cheese
Return to menu
In general, don’t wrap your cheese in plastic or foil, and don’t store it in a container or zip-top bag, says Michaela Weitzer, interim assistant manager of events and education at Murray’s Cheese in New York. “They all need to be able to breathe properly so that they stay at optimal freshness for as long as possible,” she says. Plastic essentially suffocates cheese and then makes it taste stale, Saxelby writes. One exception: Weitzer says if you want to keep cheese aged in the plastic, such as cheddar blocks, in the original packaging, that’s okay. Personally, I seem incapable of keeping it intact and prefer one of the alternatives below.

Wax paper is a great option for wrapping cheese, Weitzer says, because it allows for the cheese to breathe. The same goes for cheese paper, which you can buy or reuse from your cheese shop, and reusable beeswax wraps, such as Bee’s Wrap. You can loosely wrap any type of cheese in one of these options, securing with tape, if needed.

If you bought a cheese in a brine, such as feta, burrata or fresh mozzarella, you can store these with the brine in the container they came in.

As to where to store cheese, choose your refrigerator’s vegetable crisper or cheese drawers. The higher humidity will prevent the cheese from drying out. The cheese will also be shielded from the colder air circulating through the fridge. One important point: Take cheese out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving for ideal flavor and texture.

Storing cheese in the fridge

“The shelf life of a cheese will depend on the type of cheese and the storage method being used,” Weitzer says. Her advice:

Fresh cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta and fresh goat cheese): Consume as soon as possible, ideally within three days of purchase.
Semi-firm cheeses (younger Gouda and cheddars): Two weeks, when wrapped properly. “You will notice them drying out when they are on their way out.”
Firm cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano and other very aged cheeses): Three weeks in good wrapping.
Blue cheese: Two weeks wrapped well; “I know this one can be harder to tell when it goes bad.”
Ripened/washed or bloomy rind (brie, Camembert): One and a half weeks, with wrapping.
3
Don’t freeze cheese
Return to menu
Saxelby does not recommend freezing cheese. “Milk is a complex, fragile matrix of fat, protein, water, vitamins, and minerals that can be coaxed into a more solid form by a cheesemaker,” she writes. “If you freeze your cheese, you are altering this delicate matrix in an irreversible way.” Freezing cheese may dull its flavor and create a grainy texture.

If you do choose to freeze cheese, your best bet is hard cheese in blocks (not sliced). I’ve also had great luck with tubs of fresh chevre from my farmers market.

How to handle moldy cheese
Return to menu
The USDA offers detailed guidance on how to handle cheese with mold on it. For hard cheeses where the mold is not part of the processing, cut at least 1 inch around and below the mold, taking care not to drag the knife through the mold and cross contaminate the rest. Cover the cheese in fresh wrap, and you’re good to go.

Sprouting onions and scarred tomatoes: How to tell whether fading produce is still safe to eat

For soft cheeses made with mold, such as blue, brie and Camembert, discard any that sport mold that is not part of the cheesemaking process. You’ll be able to tell the difference on soft, ripened cheeses, according to Saxelby, because the rind may look yellow, brown, grayish or slimy, rather than the original white. If there’s atypical surface mold on a mold-processed hard cheese, such as Stilton or Gorgonzola, use the same advice for hard cheese above.

Do not eat soft cheeses (cottage, cream cheese, chevre) with mold, the USDA advices, because they can be contaminated below the surface. The same goes for sliced, shredded or crumbled cheeses, the contamination of which can be hard to discern. 5
Uses for old cheese
Return to menu
Maybe you have more cheese than you can consume in its ideal window or it has over-ripened and is a little stronger than you want it to taste. Perhaps you left it around long enough that it’s dried out. Assuming those are the main issues and there’s no unwanted mold as described above, feel free to salvage the cheese in other uses. Use assorted bits in such dishes as Fromage Fort or Classic Swiss Fondue. Mac and cheese is always an option, and many hard cheeses can be shredded and baked into cheese crisps (frico).

0;From heart disease to IUDs: How doctors dismiss women’s pain;"One woman was told she was being “dramatic” when she pleaded for a brain scan after suffering months of headaches and pounding in her ears. It turned out she had a brain tumor.

Another was ignored as she cried out in pain during a 33-hour labor. She was supposed to be getting pain medication through her epidural, but it had fallen out.

Dozens of women complained of torturous pain as their vaginal walls were punctured during an egg retrieval process. They were told their pain was normal, but, in actuality, they were getting saline instead of anesthesia.

These are just some of the stories of women who say their pain and suffering has been dismissed or misdiagnosed by doctors. Although these are anecdotal reports, a number of studies support the claim that women in pain often are not taken as seriously as men. This year, the Journal of the American Heart Association reported that women who visited emergency departments with chest pain waited 29 percent longer than men to be evaluated for possible heart attacks.

An analysis of 981 emergency room visits showed that women with acute abdominal pain were up to 25 percent less likely than their male counterparts to be treated with powerful opioid painkillers.

Another study showed that middle-aged women with chest pain and other symptoms of heart disease were twice as likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness compared with men who had the same symptoms.

“I was told I knew too much, that I was working too hard, that I was stressed out, that I was anxious,” said Ilene Ruhoy, a 53-year-old neurologist from Seattle, who had head pain and pounding in her ears.

Despite having a medical degree, Ruhoy said she struggled to get doctors to order a brain scan. By the time she got it in 2015, a tennis ball-sized tumor was pushing her brain to one side. She needed surgery, but first, she rushed home, hugged her 11-year-old daughter and wrote her a letter to tell her goodbye.

Ruhoy did not die on the operating table, but her tumor had grown so large it could not be entirely removed. Now, she has several smaller tumors that require radiation treatment.

She said many of her female patients have had experiences similar to hers. “They’re not validated with regards to their concerns; they’re gaslit; they’re not understood,” she said. “They feel like no one is listening to them.” Doubts about women’s pain can affect treatment for a wide range of health issues, including heart problems, stroke, reproductive health, chronic illnesses, adolescent pain and physical pain, among other things, studies show.

Research also suggests that women are more sensitive to pain than men and are more likely to express it, so their pain is often seen as an overreaction rather than a reality, said Roger Fillingim, director of the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence at the University of Florida.

Fillingim, who co-wrote a review article on sex differences in pain, said there are many possible explanations, including hormones, genetics and even social factors such as gender roles.

Regardless, he said, “you treat the pain that the patient has, not the pain that you think the patient should have.” ";https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/?itid=sf_wellbeing_wellbeing_Top%20table_p001_f001
0;What do Democrats do with Kyrsten Sinema in 2024?;"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s (D-Ariz.) decision to become an independent makes plenty of sense for Kyrsten Sinema. For her party, though, a member who has already delivered several headaches in the past has created what might be her biggest one to date.

The question is what the party does in 2024 if Sinema runs for reelection. Do national Democrats back the incumbent, who will apparently continue to caucus with them? Or will they line up behind a Democratic nominee who would be more in line with the base?

So far, Democratic leaders are straining to avoid answering that hypothetical. The Arizona Democratic Party has excoriated Sinema for the move, but the national party is taking a very different tack, clearly hoping to keep its powder dry until it has to make a choice.

If history is any guide, the answer is: They’ll back whoever is mostly likely to win. But while this current situation bears similarities to others from recent years, it carries with it some dynamics we simply haven’t seen. There are two other independents who caucus with Democrats: Maine’s Angus King and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders. Both are more reliable votes for the blue side, and largely because of that, neither has run into a Democratic opponent like Sinema might.

Sanders routinely wins Democratic primaries but then opts to run as an independent. King did face a somewhat high-profile Democratic state lawmaker when he first ran for Senate in 2012, and there was some consternation about which candidate the party would back, given that King had declined to commit to caucusing with Democrats. But because the former governor was always the heavy favorite to win that race, the situation never really posed a difficult choice for national Democrats.

(It did occasion one of my favorite campaign headlines in recent years, via Politico’s Alex Burns: “Maine Dem reminds DSCC she exists.”) About the best analogues to today involve two other incumbents who were effectively forced to run as independents because they lost their party’s primaries: Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) in 2006 and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in 2010.

In both cases, the national party talked a good game about supporting the candidate who won their primary. But that soon gave way to the reality on the ground.

In Connecticut, Democratic leaders issued a series of statements backing Ned Lamont after he beat Lieberman in a primary. But when Lieberman ran as a third-party candidate and looked like he was about to win, the party did little about it — in large part because there was no real threat of the Republican shooting the gap. Lieberman wound up winning with the support of 7 in 10 Republicans. The national Democratic Party spent basically nothing on the race. In Alaska, things were a little dicier, because there was some concern about a Democrat winning the race. So while national Republicans endorsed Republican nominee Joe Miller over Murkowski’s write-in bid — like Democrats did in Connecticut — they soon, and pretty publicly, backed away. That was in part because Miller proved a very flawed candidate, but also because Murkowski appeared to have a good shot at winning.

In the closing weeks of the race, the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s advertising focused almost exclusively on attacking the Democrat, without addressing the choice between Miller and Murkowski. By the end, amid some pressure, it did provide some support for Miller’s effort litigating write-in votes for Murkowski, but it was clearly hedging its bets rather than going all-out for the GOP nominee — to the consternation of some on the right.

Why Democrats won’t punish Sinema’s betrayal, at least for now

But even that is likely to pale in comparison to the difficult choices that a matchup between Sinema and a Democratic nominee would present. And that’s where the historical comparisons break down. Sinema is one of the two most unpopular members of the Democratic caucus in Washington. And while some reserve more distaste for Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), at least he comes from a heavily conservative state where his voting record would seem easier to explain.

If there’s a parallel with any of the names above, it might be Lieberman, who was a Democrat in blue state. But the liberal hatred for Lieberman really took off after his 2006 primary; as of that summer, Democrats still generally liked Lieberman more than they disliked him.

Sinema doesn’t benefit from such goodwill from her now-former party. A September poll showed that 57 percent of Arizona Democrats had an unfavorable opinion of her, compared to 37 percent favorable.

And given the distaste for her from the activist and donor classes — combined the with increasing intolerance, from each party’s base, of alleged apostates — it might be very difficult for national Democrats to back her or even just sit the contest out. And that goes double given that Arizona is a swing state, unlike any of the other states mentioned above. This is not a situation where victory is a sure thing for one of the two candidates who would caucus on their side, allowing the party to punt on picking sides. There will be pressure to get involved, since a somewhat even split of Democratic votes could hand the race to Republicans. The real problems creep in if it looks like Sinema has a better shot than the Democratic nominee, be it Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) or someone else. At that point, the party will surely want to back the most likely winner, as it almost always does — and especially in a year in which the party is expected to play extensive defense while defending its narrow 51-49 majority. But selling that decision to a base that feels like a West Virginia Democrat should be a loyal party line vote would be another matter entirely.

On the other hand, what if it’s looking close and the party backs the Democratic nominee? They risk further alienating a potentially reelected Sinema, to the point where they might have to worry about her leaving the caucus entirely.

There are no easy answers. And while Sinema remains in the fold of the Democratic caucus, it could be their most electorally problematic party switch in some time.";https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/13/democrats-2024-kyrsten-sinema-problem/

0;Kari Lake was unflinchingly loyal to Trump. Then her campaign unraveled.;"PHOENIX — After Kari Lake rode former president Donald Trump’s endorsement to the Republican nomination for governor of Arizona, some of her aides and allies urged her to moderate her campaign to compete in the November election.

Advisers wanted her to focus less on Trump’s false claims of voter fraud and more on homelessness, water independence and border security, according to people familiar with their counsel. Business leaders recommended that she tone down her MAGA message to create a friendlier climate for capital. Republican strategists asked her to stop denigrating early ballots, a method of voting once critical to Republican victories in the state.

In an August meeting at the state party’s headquarters, GOP operatives delivered a warning, which was recalled by two attendees: Campaigns that failed to mobilize supporters to vote early would be at a disadvantage. After pushback from some members of Lake’s team, the candidate herself spoke up. She said that True The Vote, the Texas-based group pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud, had told her to instruct supporters to mail in their ballots — not put them in drop boxes — as a way to “confuse the Democrats.” The eyebrow-raising comment made clear to those present that Lake, 53, was a true believer, cocooned in a pro-Trump echo chamber.

“She would never break frame,” said a fellow Republican who spoke with Lake about her refusal to acknowledge Trump’s defeat. “She’d sort of look at you with a puzzled face and be like, ‘But the election was stolen in 2020.’”

The person was among 32 outside allies, senior advisers and business leaders interviewed for this report. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations or avoid professional reprisal.

Lake burst onto the national political stage this year as perhaps the purest embodiment of Trump’s grievance-fueled brand of politics. Her slash-and-burn campaign operation courted controversy, stoked distrust in the democratic process and earned her mentions as Trump’s possible 2024 vice-presidential pick — or perhaps even a presidential candidate herself. Then she lost.

Now, her failed campaign offers a case study in how Trump has warped the GOP’s electoral prospects. The positions adopted by candidates to win his endorsement — often necessary to get through the gantlet of GOP primaries — appear untenable in the battleground states that Republicans would need to win to reclaim the White House. Foremost among those positions is refusal to accept the outcome of elections, which Lake made a rallying cry. As she transformed herself from a local television news anchor into a standard-bearer for Trump’s political movement, her campaign became a test of the power, and limits, of his politics.

Lake declined to be interviewed for this story.

Interviews, internal documents and voting data point to the reasons behind her defeat: The candidate, so focused on parroting Trump and settling personal scores, failed to execute on a plan to court the independents and centrist Republicans who decide elections in Arizona, once a red state that now gleams purple. As advisers urged her to consolidate GOP support after the primary, Lake remained fixated on a grudge match against people loyal to the legacy of the late Sen. John McCain. In the race’s closing days, she appeared in the suburbs alongside Stephen K. Bannon, the far-right radio host and former Trump strategist who was sentenced in October to four months in prison for contempt of Congress.

A meaningful share of Republican voters showed up to the polls but spurned Lake. Statewide, she received nearly 120,000 fewer votes than did the victorious Republican candidate for state treasurer, Kimberly Yee, who stressed financial literacy and fiscal discipline on the campaign trail instead of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Nine percent of self-described Republicans went so far as to vote for Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs, according to exit polling. Independents broke for Hobbs by seven percentage points.

While early signs of Lake’s undoing now blink brightly, the race was close. She lost to Hobbs by just 17,000 votes — less than a percentage point. And she ran ahead of Blake Masters, the GOP nominee for Senate. “There’s all this hand-wringing, but with a margin that close, there were a bunch of ways to close the gap,” said Sam Stone, Lake’s policy director. The biggest barrier, Stone said, is that the “majority of Arizonans don’t want to vote for Trump or Trump-affiliated candidates.”

A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The circumstances of Lake’s loss share some features with disappointing GOP results elsewhere. Other aspects are unique to her unconventional first-time candidacy, which gained her celebrity status nationally but failed to win enough votes back home in Arizona.

Her loss is unique in another way. She has refused to accept it.

Rather than concede, as other major election deniers who lost in 2022 have done, she has pointed to problems with printers in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, that caused many voters to wait in line, travel to another polling place or deposit their ballots in secure drawers for tabulation at the county’s main site downtown. An Arizona judge found that the mechanical problems did not prevent anyone from voting. Lake last week filed a lawsuit seeking an order allowing her to inspect 1.5 million ballots in Maricopa County and declaring her the winner of the election, among other demands. She issued a statement attacking the county, vowing, “I will continue to fight for the appropriate remedy to the mass voter disenfranchisement that clearly affected the outcome of this election.”

Trump’s antipathy for losers is widely known. But he has welcomed Lake twice to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida since her defeat in Arizona. On social media, he has spread falsehoods about Arizona’s elections and called for her to be “installed” as governor. The effect has been to nationalize her loss — an emblem of the hard fall that could await all candidates running proxy Trump campaigns in states he lost.

“It was both a collapse and, now in hindsight, it was a failed campaign from the beginning,” said a high-ranking Arizona Republican. “I don’t really know what to say beyond outrageous arrogance and never getting out of primary mode. This election wasn’t stolen. It was given away.” ‘Sensationalize everything’
Lake left her job as a local Fox anchor in March 2021, saying in a direct-to-camera video that she had grown disillusioned with the media. “I began to feel that I was contributing to the fear and division in this country by continuing on in this profession,” she said. Two months later, she came across a young operative, Colton Duncan, who would become critical to her nascent political career. The pair met at a dinner in D.C. hosted by the head of the Log Cabin Republicans, the conservative gay and lesbian political organization, according to two people with knowledge of the event. Duncan was working at a firm called Arsenal, which made its name in viral video productions, and had previously worked at the pro-Trump youth group Turning Point USA.

In June, Arsenal signed her as a client. Its leaders took on prominent roles advising her fledgling campaign.

People who interacted with Lake said they were impressed by her charisma and communication skills, which allowed her to display a mastery of complex topics. More personally, she displayed an uncommon degree of empathy toward staff, aides said, cultivating loyalty in return. One young aide on occasion ended calls with her by saying, “I love you.” Lake spent the summer seeking to win the favor of Trump and his associates.

In August, she headed for South Dakota, where Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO, was holding a “Cyber Symposium” to air debunked claims about fraud in the 2020 election. She appeared on Bannon’s “War Room” show from the symposium — part of a strategy to win over the party’s right flank, as an adviser recalled, and bolster her pro-Trump bona fides.

It worked. Trump endorsed her the following month, rewarding her for her unrelenting focus on his false claims of voter fraud and saying she would “fight to restore Election Integrity (both past and future!).”

That fall, Lake had her first fundraiser at Trump’s Florida retreat. Her campaign would ultimately spend more than $100,000 at Mar-a-Lago, state filings show.

Lake and Trump spoke regularly in the ensuing months, according to advisers. The pair discussed speculation that she could be his vice-presidential pick when he praised how she responded to a question about the topic, telling reporters she would be their “worst freaking nightmare for eight years” in the governor’s office, according to a person familiar with the conversation. During the campaign, she kept Trump informed about polling and upcoming rallies, a former adviser said. She built her national profile by sparring with a growing group of media outlets that flocked to those rallies. A former adviser estimated she had notched more than $300 million worth of free media coverage over the course of the primary, compared with about $50 million for her main opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson, a conservative who rejected the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.

Against the advice of at least one adviser, Lake took aim at Robson’s husband, a developer and business leader with a vast financial and political network.

She also ignored at least two aides who urged her during a meeting in May not to oppose mail-in ballots. Stone, her campaign’s policy director, said Republicans paid the price for neglecting the mail-ballot operation once integral to the political machine managed by McCain.

“This has been missing for several cycles now,” Stone said. “And we’re getting our butts handed to us.”

Another adviser said Lake’s approach was guided not by data but by her instincts and her past as a newscaster. “She wanted to be a television person at heart,” the adviser said. “She wanted to sensationalize everything.”

That approach landed her in the middle of the country’s most volatile culture wars. In June, a tweet from her account vilified drag queens — part of a sustained GOP effort to paint gender nonconformity as menacing to children. But the post ran counter to Lake’s own history of attending drag shows and hosting one at her home, as a performer and former friend of hers publicly recounted.

Lake convened staff on a call, according to a person who participated, and helped craft a plan “to dig in,” as the person said, contesting the performer’s claims and threatening to sue him. No suit was ever filed.

Lake’s bare-knuckled approach to political controversy drew comparisons to Trump while also eliciting speculation among Arizona Republicans that she could be his running mate in 2024.

Democratic operatives also took notice, with David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, telling Axios that Lake looked like a “plausible presidential candidate.” ‘Scorched earth’
The day after the Aug. 2 primary, Lake’s sleep-deprived staff gathered in a campaign conference room.

Advisers told her that voters already knew she was endorsed by Trump and urged her to begin tailoring her message to the general election, which was three months away. To win in November, they said, she would have to broaden her appeal.

“The idea we tried to get across was, ‘We don’t need to spend another penny calling you the Trump candidate,’” one person who participated in the discussions recalled.

Business leaders who met with Lake periodically also urged her to “reduce the intensity of the so-called MAGA message,” one participant described. “She took [the advice] for a while.”

But Lake tired of that strategy, which aides said she felt wasn’t “genuine” or “scorched earth enough.” She sidelined her general consultant and elevated Caroline Wren, a veteran GOP fundraiser with close ties to Trump who was listed as a “VIP Advisor” on the permit for the rally at the White House Ellipse that preceded the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.

Wren brought extensive fundraising networks to the campaign and helped channel the energy of young staffers and volunteers who flocked to Lake because of her charisma and national profile. But some on the campaign said Wren indulged the candidate’s combative impulses while irking other staffers, on at least one occasion prompting a complaint about disrespectful workplace conduct.

Wren declined to address a question about the episode.

One adviser said the influx of former Trump aides in the campaign’s final weeks sent the wrong message. “They saw the race as their ticket to a vice-presidential candidate,” the adviser said.

Lake was her own decision-maker, aides said, and her decision was never to put distance between herself and Trump. One campaign ally proposed that Lake tell Trump to travel to Arizona no later than early September, allowing her to differentiate herself from the divisive former president before early voting began in October.

On Oct. 9, however, Trump came to town. Lake vacuumed a red carpet for him in an image blasted out by her allies as an example of “servant leadership.” Critics saw it as flagrant bootlicking.

Rather than honing her message to Arizona voters, Lake lent her name to gubernatorial candidates out of state, endorsing Tudor Dixon in Michigan and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania — both of whom also ended up losing their races. Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, meanwhile, both traveled to Arizona to stump for her. But she was never endorsed by her primary opponents and she never appeared with Doug Ducey, the sitting Republican governor.

So confident was Lake that her operation was on the right track that she redirected donors to Masters in the campaign’s final weeks.

Behind the scenes in the early fall, a small group of campaign staff, supporters and business allies gathered to begin preparing for a transition to governing the state. Participants met every Friday and wrote regular reports for the campaign.

The plans envisioned a “Victory Tour” across Arizona. Transition documents show that aides and supporters already had names for key roles, from chief lobbyist to border czar. The team used a color-coded scoring system to evaluate state agencies they anticipated would soon fall under their control.

After scorning McCain’s memory in virtually every other respect, Arizona’s GOP slate held to an election-eve tradition he followed. They gathered at the steps of a courthouse north of Phoenix where Barry Goldwater launched his presidential bid in 1964 — and where McCain took to rallying supporters before asking for their votes.

This year, Bannon closed down the rally.

“This is not a campaign, it’s a movement,” Bannon said, one that would “end here tomorrow, with the election of Kari Lake as governor!” ‘It just all went wrong’
When printer problems emerged in Maricopa County on Election Day, Wren and Lake piled into a car, driven by Lake’s husband, to visit polling places affected by the errant printers.

They called Masters, who was also touring sites. Together, they stood behind a 75-foot line at a voting location, using a bullhorn to urge people not to leave.

That night, the first release of preliminary results looked grim for Republicans. But another drop, shortly after midnight, looked more favorable, and cheers erupted in the GOP’s “war room” in a Scottsdale resort, according to someone who was there.

In the ensuing days, as it became clear the results were not breaking for Lake, views varied about how to respond. Some people in the war room remained confident. Ric Grenell, Trump’s former ambassador to Germany and acting intelligence director, “thought it was done and won,” one person said.

But the campaign’s own data showed that defeat was possible, even likely, despite favorable polls.

“I think we were aware of everything that could go wrong — it just all went wrong,” said someone who viewed internal modeling, which showed Lake underperforming Trump’s 2020 results in key areas, such as Pima County, home to Tucson, which was outside her reach as a Phoenix-based news anchor.

“You can’t fix things when you don’t have the resources to do it or the interest to move to the middle on key issues,” this person said.

Lake’s advisers told her four days after the election, on Saturday, Nov. 12, that she had lost, according to Don Huffines, a businessman and former Texas state senator who had helped raise money for her and had been tapped to be chief of staff in a Lake administration.

“It was very memorable,” Huffines said, describing a scene in which aides and allies huddled in the war room as votes were still being tabulated and released. Lake joined from her home. “She kind of started crying on the phone a little bit. It was a very emotional time right then. And she wasn’t emotional for herself. It wasn’t for show. She was upset for the people of Arizona.”

Those participating in the discussion, Huffines said, included Bannon and Floyd Brown, the longtime conservative operative and founder of the Western Journal website, whose recent headlines label Biden a “fool” and decry “woke pandering.”

Huffines said Bannon was measured, in contrast to his public declarations. He advised her to use the campaign’s resources to pursue litigation that would uncover any potential fraud. Lake at one point expressed concern that she would have to cover those costs personally, Huffines said.

Some of Lake’s allies wanted Masters to wait to concede, but he bowed out several days following his projected loss. Mark Finchem, the failed Republican candidate for secretary of state, has not conceded and has joined Lake in circulating unproven claims that the election was stolen. The race for attorney general is going to a recount, with Republican Abe Hamadeh trailing by 511 votes.

People familiar with the post-election discussions say it has mostly fallen to Wren to reconcile Lake to her loss, even as the former candidate promotes her lawsuit and shares posts calling for a revote.

One person said the decision not to go “full ‘Stop the Steal’” — a reference to the rallying cry that brought protesters to D.C. on Jan. 6 — is shaped by the experience of the Capitol attack, which led to a raft of investigations, some of them involving people on the Lake campaign. Lake has not called for protests, even as she promises to keep “fighting.”

In the meantime, she has been weighing what to do next, according to those in touch with her. She has been approached about media jobs, these people said, but is inclined to go in a different direction, possibly acting as a surrogate for Trump’s 2024 campaign.

“Listen, I don’t know what the future holds,” she said in remarks at Mar-a-Lago this month, according to an audio recording obtained by The Washington Post, “but I know I got a lot of fight left in me.”

1;South Africa’s parliament votes against motion to impeach Cyril Ramaphosa;"South Africa’s parliament has voted against launching an impeachment process against embattled president Cyril Ramaphosa, boosting the veteran politician’s effort to win a second term as leader of the ruling African National Congress at a key elective conference that opens later this week.

The motion to impeach Ramaphosa followed a report by an independent panel appointed by parliament that accused the veteran politician of serious misconduct after the theft from his private game ranch of somewhere between $500,000 (?410,000) and $5m in cash almost three years ago.

The funds, reportedly the proceeds of the sale of cattle, were allegedly hidden in a sofa when they were taken.

With the ANC dominant in parliament it was always unlikely impeachment would go ahead and the motion was defeated by 214 to 148 votes.

Ramaphosa, who took power in 2018, has been accused of holding undeclared foreign currency, tax evasion, failing to inform police about the robbery and misusing state resources by ordering a senior presidential bodyguard to track down the thieves, who then appear to have been paid off. He has denied all wrongdoing and launched legal action to challenge the report. The scandal, dubbed “Farmgate” by local media, reopened deep divisions between factions within the party, encouraging the president’s opponents who have called for his resignation.

Several rivals of Ramaphosa either voted for the impeachment motion or absented themselves during the vote, despite orders from the ANC for all parliamentarians to follow a party order to oppose it.

Opposition parties had sought to stiffen support for an impeachment, an unprecedented move under South Africa’s constitution.

“Mr President you stand accused of theft from the people of South Africa, you stand accused of violating your oath of office and of violating our constitution,” the radical leftwing Economic Freedom Fighters said on Twitter after the vote.

The prospect of months of political turmoil will dismay many in South Africa, which is struggling with rolling power cuts, soaring unemployment and a flagging economy. Ramaphosa has welcomed a separate police inquiry into the allegations against him. He has not been charged with any crimes and will stand for re-election as party leader at a crucial elective conference which begins later this week.

Most ANC politicians recognise that Ramaphosa remains the only party leader with broad appeal, which may mean parliamentarians will hesitate before initiating a process that could remove him from office with general elections expected in 2024, observers say.

The ANC’s historic popularity has been battered by allegations of endemic corruption. The party has been in power for 28 years but has lost support in towns and cities in recent years, with its vote share of about 50% maintained only by backing from poorer, rural communities where the party’s brand of patronage-based politics works best.

1;African leaders gather in US as Joe Biden aims to reboot rocky relations;"Dozens of African leaders have assembled in Washington for a summit aimed at rebooting US relations on the continent, which have languished in recent years.

The US-Africa summit, the first since 2014, will be the biggest international gathering in Washington since the pandemic and the most substantial commitment by a US administration to boosting its influence in the region for almost a decade.

The summit comes amid the sharpest great power rivalry for many decades, worsening security problems and acute economic problems in Africa.

All three challenges are sometimes blamed on the US, which has been pushed on to the defensive in many areas by determined and often unconventional strategies adopted by strategic rivals such as Russia and China.

In all, 49 leaders and heads of states have been invited to the summit, and the guest list underlines the difficulty faced by President Joe Biden and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in balancing values with pressing demands of power politics.

Observers have noted tensions in US policy between a desire to win friends and also to reach out to populations suffering under repressive, exploitative regimes through promotion of diversity, tolerance, free speech and democracy.

“It seems it’s now a numbers game and getting more countries to align with the west against Russia now and, in the longer term, China. The continent feels a lot more cold war-ish than at any time in my career,” said Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at Chatham House.

Four countries that were suspended from the African Union – Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Sudan – were not invited to the summit because coups in those nations led to unconstitutional changes in power. The White House also did not invite Eritrea.

But Equatorial Guinea was invited despite the state department stating that it held “serious doubts” about last month’s election, in which President Teodoro Obiang’s ruling party won nearly 95% of the vote.

So too was Zimbabwe, which has faced years of US and western sanctions over poor governance, human rights abuses and widespread corruption, and Ethiopia, some of whose commercial privileges were withdrawn in an attempt to force an end to a war in the Tigray region that led to “gross violations” of human rights.

A peace deal was signed last month, with the significant involvement of US diplomats, but implementation faces major challenges.

Many African leaders have come with their own agendas, such as seeking help with high debt repayments, the devastating legacy of the coronavirus, climate change, or military assistance. Most countries are suffering too from the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has pushed up inflation and disrupted food supplies.

Geopolitical competition goes beyond that between China, Russia, the EU and the US to include middling powers such as Turkey, Japan, the Gulf states and the UK too, said Vines.

On a tour of three countries in Africa earlier this year, Blinken appealed to “governments, communities and peoples” across Africa to embrace Washington’s vision of democracy, openness and economic partnership.

The US diplomatic strategy appears in part to appeal directly to ordinary people in Africa, rather than their leaders, by promising support for democracy and accountability. Few rulers on the continent welcome Washington’s admonishments about their often poor human rights records or failures to implement political reform.

“I do strongly believe that the United States is still seen as a superpower from the African perspective, but most African leaders do not want to align with its promotion of democracy,” said Abraham Kuol Nyuon, a political analyst and associate professor of political science at the University of Juba in South Sudan. “They need the support of America but not the system of America.”

China has made little secret of its preference for strongman rulers, offering assistance without conditions. Sub-Saharan nations have also been major recipients of Chinese investment through its now flagging “belt and road initiative”, which supported infrastructure development. The Russian strategy has been more opportunistic, and has been focused on unstable countries with significant resources such as Sudan or those where once pro-western political leaders are now seeking new allies.

On his tour, Blinken sought to counter Russian and Chinese accusations that the US is a “neo-imperialist power” by stressing that Washington wants to act in consultation with local leaders and communities, reinforcing existing African initiatives.

“The United States prioritises our relationship with Africa for the sake of our mutual interests and our partnership in dealing with global challenges,” said Molly Phee, an assistant secretary of state for African affairs. “We are very conscious, again, of the cold war history, we’re conscious, again, of the deleterious impact of colonialism on Africa, and we studiously seek to avoid repeating some of the mistakes of those earlier eras.”

A further aim is to make sure failures of Trump’s administration – marked by drift and a series of insulting gaffes – are forgotten.

African leaders will be looking for Biden to make some big commitments during the summit, including announcing his first presidential visit to sub-Saharan Africa. One crowdpleaser may be support for adding the African Union as a permanent member of the G20, according to the White House.

The Senegalese president, Macky Sall, the current AU chair, has argued that by adding the African Union, the G20 “would come to represent the views of 54 additional members, the bulk of low-income countries, and about 80% of the world’s population”.

He wrote in July: “The G20 compromises its effectiveness and influence by omitting such a large fraction of humanity and the world economy.”

“We came to assess the damage and the primary damage we see is human,” Lukonde said on state television on Tuesday.

About 12 million people live in the 24 neighbourhoods of Kinshasa that were hit by the floods, according to three local officials who told the Associated Press that people were killed, houses submerged and roads ruined.

In the Ngaliema area, more than three dozen people were known to have died so far, said the area’s mayor, Alid’or Tshibanda.

In another area, five members of one family died, some by electrocution.

“It is a just calamity,” said Pierrot Mantuela, 30, whose mother, nine-year-old daughter and three brothers were killed. “It’s sad to lose all the members of my family.” He said he was spared because he was working on Monday night when the rain began.

Officials said much of the destruction happened in houses built on plots without official permission. “They have no documents. They are chased away but they always come back,” Dieumerci Mayibazilwanga, the mayor of Mont-Ngafula, said of people building unauthorised houses.

1;Canada: son of murdered billionaire couple triples cash reward to C$35m;"The son of a billionaire couple murdered five years ago has tripled a cash reward for information about the unsolved crime amid frustration over a lack of progress in the investigation and deep rifts within the family.

Barry Sherman, the founder of drug giant Apotex, and his wife, Honey, are believed to have been killed in their Toronto home on 13 December 2017. A realtor found the couple in the basement pool area of their home two days later, with belts looped around their necks and attached to a pool railing.

Police initially believed the deaths to be a murder-suicide. Investigators later determined the couple were victims of a “targeted” double homicide, but five years on, the crime remains unsolved.

Last year, investigators asked the public to help identify the “walking person”, a figure on a sidewalk whose actions were “highly suspicious”, said police in an apparent breakthrough. Police believe the man is linked to the murders, but have still failed to identify him.

“Closure will not be possible until those responsible for this evil act are brought to justice,” Jonathon Sherman, the couple’s son, said in a statement shared with CBC Toronto. “I have been overwhelmed with pain, loss, and sorrow and these feelings only continuously compound.”

Last week, Jonathon’s sister Alexandra Krawczyk confirmed that the family’s C$10m reward had so far gone unclaimed.

Now, Jonathon has added C$25m of his own money to increase the reward to C$35m.

“This immeasurable pain is felt every day when I realize that my own two children will never have the privilege of meeting my parents who made their lives possible for me and my husband,” he said. “I continue to miss my parents more than I can describe, and I am forever haunted by what happened to them.”

In recent years, Jonathan has said that Alexandra has suggested he could have played a role in their parents’ deaths, fracturing a relationship between the two siblings.

Barry had reportedly asked Jonathon to repay him $C50m amid a cash shortage at Barry’s company, Apotex, in the weeks leading up to the killings.

“I can tell you I was not involved,” Jonathon, who is understood no longer to be on speaking terms with Alexandra, told the Toronto Star in January last year.

The Toronto police have said the investigation remains open and they remain “committed to resolving this case and bringing closure to the family and friends” of the Shermans.

1;Peru president paves way for early elections after two killed in latest protests;"Peru’s new president, Dina Boluarte, has announced plans to move forward with general elections amid deadly protests over the ousting of her predecessor Pedro Castillo after he attempted to dissolve congress. In a televised address early on Monday, Boluarte said she would submit a bill to bring general elections forward two years, to April 2024. But her proposal is unlikely to placate surging protests as Castillo supporters call for Peru’s widely loathed congress to be closed and early elections.

Boluarte’s announcement came after days of violent unrest across the country. In the city of Andahuaylas, clashes between Castillo supporters and police lead to two deaths – a 15- and 18-year-old – and four injured – among them a 19-year-old who is in a serious condition.

The two adolescents died “possibly as a result of gunshot wounds”, the head of Peru’s human rights ombudsman’s office, Eliana Revollar, told national radio. Boluarte announced a state of emergency in the zones of “high social conflict” in the southern regions of Apur?mac, Arequipa and Ica, where protesters angry at what they see as a coup plot by congress to oust Castillo have blocked roads and stalled two airports.

 Protests were widespread in rural strongholds of support for Castillo, a former schoolteacher and political novice from a poor Andean region, who was removed from office and detained on charges of “rebellion” on Wednesday after he announced he would shutter congress and rule by decree – just hours before he was due to face an impeachment vote. On Sunday, congress stripped Castillo of presidential immunity as he faces charges of “breaching the constitution”.

The demonstrators accuse Boluarte – Castillo’s vice-president who was sworn in just hours after he was ousted – of betraying the former leader and usurping the presidency. Protesters in the capital, Lima, joined thousands across the country clashing with riot police who used teargas and baton charges to push them back.

“We don’t agree with the way our president was ousted, with lies and trickery,” said Laura Pacheco, a Castillo supporter protesting in San Mart?n square in downtown Lima.

“[Boluarte] doesn’t deserve to be president, she hasn’t been elected by the people. We are defending our democratic rights, we don’t want to be governed by a usurper,” she added.

Luc?a, who did not want to give her last name, was among hundreds of horn-blaring, flag-waving protesters calling for Boluarte and the deeply unpopular congress to go.

“We want the congress to be shut down, we want new elections for Peru, where the people can choose who governs them,” she said

“Castillo tried to shut down congress because that’s what the people wanted. It’s a vipers’ nest!” she added, highlighting the widely held view that the unicameral congress is a venal hub of vested interests and corruption.

While virtually all the protesters called for the shutdown of congress, some held placards calling Castillo a “national hero” – not because of his inept government but because he attempted to close the hated chamber, which has been consistently more despised than the roster of unpopular former presidents.

Some 86% of Peruvians disapprove of congress, more than the 61% disapproval rating for Castillo, according to a November opinion poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies. The same poll indicated that the vast majority of Peruvians, 87%, would prefer fresh general elections and a renewed congress in the event that Castillo was ousted.

“The crisis has not abated,” said Fernando Tuesta, a political science professor at Lima’s Pontifical Catholic University and former head of Peru’s electoral authority.

“Despite the proposal to bring forward the elections, the government of Dina Boluarte, already weak, has to deal with an unreliable congress, a cabinet with holes in it and, above all, it has to know how to placate the demonstrations, which are growing angrily,” he said. “If it’s not handled well, [Boluarte] may become the centre for the attacks,” he added.

Boluarte, who had initially expressed her wish to remain in office until 2026 when Castillo’s term officially ends, expressed her condolences to the families of the teenage victims. “I deeply regret the death of our compatriots in Andahuaylas, Apur?mac, my homeland,” she said in her national address.

More than 20 journalists have been attacked during several days of protests, according to Peru’s national association of journalists, either due to “excessive use of force by police officers to aggression, insults and attempted stripping of journalists’ work equipment by demonstrators”, the association said in a statement.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/peru-protests-two-dead-and-four-injured-as-election-calls-grow-after-castillo-ousting
1;‘No one will protect us’: how Haiti has become deadly for journalists;"As the news filtered through on 30 October that another reporter had been arrested in Port-au-Prince, journalists rushed to the police station where Roberto Dimanche was being held.

The journalists demanded freedom for the radio reporter who had been jailed for covering a protest before he was detained and beaten, colleagues say.

But as the police set about dispersing the crowd of protesting journalists, one of them, Romelo Vilsaint, received a fatal shot to the head and crumpled to the concrete floor. “Some colleagues say he received a teargas canister to the head while others say that he was shot, so there are conflicting reports as to how he was killed, but there is no dispute whatsoever when it comes to determining who killed him,” said Widlore M?rancourt, editor-in-chief of AyiboPost, a Haitian independent news site. “This is a systemic problem.”

Vilsaint is one of at least eight journalists who have either been killed or gone missing in 2022 while reporting on the country’s dire sociopolitical crisis, according to Godson Lubrun, president of the Haitian Online Media Association. That number is the highest in two decades.

The island nation has become so lawless since its president, Jovenel Mo?se, was assassinated in July 2021, that the US and Mexico are considering meeting the request of the prime minister, Ariel Henry, request to send in foreign troops.

And as journalists attempt to report the reality of the spiralling violence, the worst hunger crisis in recent history and the return of cholera, they are increasingly finding themselves in the line of fire.

In January, Wilguens Louis-Saint and John Wesley Amady were shot dead and their bodies were burnt for covering the violence in an area of Port-au-Prince fought over by rival gangs.

And in September, Frantsen Charles and Tayson Latigue were murdered by heavily armed men while on assignment in Cit? Soleil, a slum controlled by the warring G9 and G-Pep gangs.

“Conditions for the press have deteriorated drastically over the last two years, to the point that it’s now one of the hemisphere’s deadliest countries for the media,” said Natalie Southwick, coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Latin America & the Caribbean program.

Many, such as Roberson Alphonse, have escaped attempts on their lives. An editor at Haiti’s longest-running newspaper Le Nouvelliste, Alphonse was shot in both arms when his car was sprayed with bullets on the way to work. Now the gangs have taken control of much of the capital they are free to use violence to silence the media with no repercussions, M?rancourt said.

“Every time we publish we put targets on our backs and there is nothing and no one willing to protect us. I’m afraid every day for my team.”

Increasingly, the aggressors are not young men in bandannas clutching assault rifles, say human rights observers. Now it is also the state which is targeting the media.

The death of Romelo Vilsaint – who was killed while protesting at the police station – is the latest example of “an attack on the freedom of the press” by security forces, says Lubrun. “Romelo Vilsaint was just doing his job as a journalist to inform.”

The general director of Haiti’s national police, Frantz Elbe, sent a statement of condolences to Vilsaint’s family and said that an investigation would be launched to establish how he died.

The police’s distrust for the media stems back to the dark days of Haiti’s dictatorship, said M?rancourt, but has grown this year as Port-Au-Prince’s streets became anarchic.

Police officers see journalists interviewing gangs or protesters as evidence that they have sided with them, said Louis-Henri Mars, the director of the Haitian peace-building non-profit Lakou Lap?.

“Some in the Haitian national police seem to accuse journalists of working for the gangs, as the journalists criticise how they repress the demonstrations,” Lap? said.

Police violence against journalists has become frequent as Henry’s government – with little military force or constitutional legitimacy – has lost control to the heavily armed gangs.

“Not only are the police failing to do the bare minimum to keep journalists safe, but in fact police officers are frequently the source of violence against the press,” Southwick said.

Attacking journalists has become a “tragically common” tactic under Henry to silence criticism and quell discontent, M?rancourt said. By cutting off press coverage, the police hope to cut off the oxygen to protests and clear people off the street.

And thanks to their impunity, which also stems back to Haiti’s dictatorship, M?rancourt said they can get away with it.

“People will tell you in Haiti that the freedom of the press comes with a price and the price to pay is sometimes your life. What nobody will tell you is that nobody will be held accountable for your death,” M?rancourt said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/haiti-journalist-deaths-police-violence
1;Bolsonaro supporters try to storm police HQ in ‘January 6-style’ rampage;"Fanatical supporters of Brazil’s outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, have torched cars and buses and tried to storm the federal police headquarters in the country’s capital in what one commentator called a botched attempt to spark a January 6-style turmoil.

The violence erupted on Monday evening after the leftwing politician who defeated Bolsonaro in October’s historic election – former president Luiz In?cio Lula da Silva – had his victory officially ratified by Brazil’s electoral court. Several hours later, hardcore Bolsonaristas who want the result overturned rampaged through the heart of Bras?lia, after a member of their radical group was arrested for allegedly trying to incite violence that would prevent Lula from being sworn in on 1 January.

Reuters said witnesses saw extremists, many wearing the yellow Brazil shirts that symbolise the president’s far-right movement, confronting security forces outside a federal police headquarters. Police used stun grenades and teargas to disperse the crowd.

Footage posted on social media by bystanders and local journalists showed militant Bolsonaro supporters setting fire to a bus.

The political commentator Thomas Traumann tweeted his condemnation, saying: “Bolsonarismo has gone from being a popular far-right movement to being a terrorist cell.”

“It’s an attempt at [replicating] the Capitol,” Traumann added in reference to the storming of the US legislature by hardcore Donald Trump supporters on 6 January 2021. “It won’t work but it’s an attempt.”

The outbreak of violence, which had reportedly subsided by Tuesday morning, has sparked fears there could be further upheaval in the lead-up to Lula’s inauguration. Hundreds of thousands of supporters are expected to attend the event, at which some of Brazil’s best-known artists will perform, including Pabllo Vittar, Paulinho da Viola, Martinho da Vila and Maria Rita. The man Lula has named as his future justice minister, Fl?vio Dino, tried to reassure Brazilians on Monday night, telling reporters: “Are there, unfortunately, people who want anti-democratic and illegal chaos? Yes there are.

1;China scraps tracking app as zero-Covid policy is dismantled;"China has announced plans to scrap its primary Covid tracking app in the latest rollback of pandemic control measures, just days after abruptly abandoning its long-running zero-Covid policy.

It came as health authorities warned of widespread infections on the horizon, and redeployed hundreds of thousands of doctors and nurses to intensive care units in preparation for an Omicron surge through the population of 1.4 billion people.

On Tuesday the government-run “communications itinerary card” will be retired, according to an official announcement on Monday. The app tracked people’s movements using mobile phone signals, identifying those who had been in high-risk areas in order to control their travel to other areas. The national app was a central pillar of the technological infrastructure that guided the government’s Covid response. A plethora of local and provincial apps used health data which often could not be shared with other regions.

Online, residents shared screenshots of their final logins and farewelled the app. “Goodbye itinerary card, concerts here I come,” wrote one person. “The past few years we have witnessed ‘history’ one time after another, and I hope that there will never be a day when it will be used again,” wrote another.

Some expressed concern about the vast amounts of personal data collected by the app and others like it. “I hope there will be mechanisms and measures to log out and delete this,” said one.

The app is the latest tenet of China’s zero-Covid policy to be dismantled. Over the past week testing requirements have been greatly reduced, domestic travel restrictions lifted, and infected people allowed to quarantine at home instead of being sent to specialised facilities.

Beijing authorities said fever clinics at hospitals in the city had received more than 22,000 patients on Sunday, 16 times the number a week ago.

“The current trend of the rapid spread of the epidemic in Beijing still exists,” Li Ang, a spokesperson for the city’s health commission, said at a briefing on Monday. “The number of fever clinic visits and flu-like cases increased significantly, and the number of … emergency calls increased sharply.”

In recent weeks, local cases have been trending lower since a late November peak of 40,052, official figures show. Sunday’s tally of 8,626 was down from 10,597 new cases the previous day. However, since mandatory testing was drastically scaled back and test stations dismantled, the official case numbers are no longer considered a reliable measurement. Videos showed long queues in Shanghai at the few remaining testing sites left open for people working in vulnerable sectors.

On Sunday China’s top disease expert warned of a coming surge in cases. Zhong Nanshan said the Omicron variant was “spreading rapidly”, and that one person could infect 22 others.

Authorities are preparing for almost 300,000 doctors and nurses to beredeployed to intensive care units across the country. China’s health system is concentrated in major cities and along the wealthier east coast. The government has faced criticism for not using the zero-Covid period to build its capacity. Nationally it has just one intensive care bed per 10,000 residents, far below other nations in the region. 3.6

With low vaccination rates among the vulnerable elderly demographics, the rapid change of rules has caused some fear and alarm among the population. There were also widespread reports of shortages of medication and rapid tests in pharmacies and online.

Ahead of January’s lunar new year – the country’s busiest travel period – Zhong urged people to get booster shots.

“It is highly unlikely that people will be restricted from travelling home for lunar new year celebrations in 2023, but it is still important to step up preparations,” he said, according to state media.

Online there was concern among students who are supposed to sit for a major exam in late December. The postgraduate admissions test requires the expected 5 million participants to travel across the country and gather in large groups.

In his interview, Zhong optimistically appeared to suggest a return to pre-pandemic life in China within months.

“I was asked when our lives can return to where we were in 2019. My view is that in the first half of next year after March,” he said, according to the South China Morning Post.

“Although I can’t guarantee it, the trend says it should be around that time.”

China’s restrictions for virus containment and control was initially successful against earlier variants of the disease and allowed most Chinese people to live a largely normal life for much of the last three years. But the system was overwhelmed by the increased transmissibility of later variants like Omicron. The government faced unprecedented protests last month against arduous and frequent lockdowns, as well as other restrictions that were having a major social and economic effects.

Seemingly in response, many of those restrictions have been abruptly shelved. Videos spread on social media showed abandoned quarantine centres and testing sites, littered with the refuse of the former policy. State media and health messaging has pivoted to emphasising the low severity of Omicron, and urging individual responsibility. One official video which shows people removing their face masks with apparent relief was criticised over its suggestion to ease mask wearing just as Covid begins to spread uncontrolled.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/china-scraps-tracking-app-amid-widespread-dismantling-of-zero-covid-policy
1;Hong Kong pressures Google to remove protest anthem from searches;"Google has refused to change its search results to display China’s national anthem, rather than a protest song, when users search for Hong Kong’s national anthem, the city’s security chief has said, expressing “great regret” at the decision.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The row comes after the police said they would investigate the playing of Glory to Hong Kong, the unofficial anthem of the 2019 pro-democracy protests, at the men’s final of a sevens rugby tournament in South Korea in November.

The song was written in 2019, just as protests erupted against China’s tightening control over the city, and was considered by many demonstrators in the former British colony to be their national anthem.

It was banned in 2020 after China imposed a sweeping national security law on the financial hub to punish what Beijing defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

The Asia Rugby association blamed “a simple human error” of playing a song downloaded from the internet instead of the correct anthem. The top search term on Google for Hong Kong’s anthem is Glory to Hong Kong.

Hong Kong’s security secretary, Chris Tang, said a request for Google to replace the protest anthem with China’s national anthem as the top search term was denied, as Google said such results were generated by an algorithm with no human input.

“We have approached Google to request that they put the correct national anthem at the top of their search results, but unfortunately Google refused,” Tang added. “We felt great regret and this has hurt the feelings of Hong Kong people.” ";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/hong-kong-google-protest-anthem-searches-china
1;Fijian British army veteran injured on Afghan tour granted right to settle;"A Fijian British army veteran who suffered from deafness after serving in Afghanistan has been allowed to return to the UK, in a case that gives hope to hundreds of other Commonwealth former soldiers living abroad.

Ioane Koroiveibau, 36, gave up on Britain in 2015 when his immigration paperwork was lost after his discharge on medical grounds, his hearing loss caused by repeated exposure to gunfire on a dangerous tour in Helmand.

But the veteran tried again after being encouraged by a campaign group and was granted the right to settle in the UK, even though his application was made well after the normal deadline, two years after a soldier has been discharged.

“It’s a very big break for me,” Koroiveibau said. “I had reached ground zero back in Fiji, so there is no way but up. Now I hope the other boys here will get the same opportunity back in the UK.” The British army actively recruits from Fiji and other Commonwealth members, with personnel from the Pacific country numbering about 1,300. Those who serve four years or are medically discharged have the right to settle in the UK.

However, hundreds of veterans from Fiji and elsewhere, many of whom served in Iraq or Afghanistan, were poorly advised or their documents mishandled. As a result they were unable to resolve their immigration status. Many simply gave up and left the UK, like Koroiveibau.

“I felt betrayed to be honest and there was nobody there to help me or direct me to the right people. After giving everything to the government and to the military, I felt they could have helped with paperwork,” he said.

Koroiveibau enlisted in 2007, winning his place after a competition, and became an infantryman in the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, the former regiment of the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. Koroiveibau spent seven months in Afghanistan in 2010 – “it was one of the most difficult tours, it was said we fired the most rounds that time,” he said – where he damaged the hearing in his right ear after numerous firefights.

“We couldn’t use ear defenders – we had to have a radio in our left ear, so the right ear was unprotected. Eventually I began to suffer from the noise, I had ringing in my ears, I had headaches, really sharp pains in the back of my head,”he said.

Worsening hearing meant he was medically discharged in 2012, but Koroiveibau believed the army would help him to settle in the UK. Progress was slow, however, so he visited an army base at Catterick to discover “my caseworker had passed away, and my file was not in any system”.

Defeated, Koroiveibau returned to Fiji, and found that his father was seriously ill, and he died soon afterwards. The former soldier said his mental health then deteriorated as well as his hearing, and he has since been diagnosed with PTSD, although there is no specialist treatment for combat trauma available in the country. Ministers have relaxed some the policies regarding Commonwealth veterans immigration status after several years of campaigning, and in February agreed to waive the normal ?2,389 application fee. But older cases were not thought able to reapply, such as the estimated 500 former personnel who had returned to Fiji from the UK.

However, a little-known exemption in Home Office policy allows veterans to settle in the UK “outside the immigration rules” if they served in a conflict zone or on humanitarian duties within 10 years. It can also apply if the only reason for refusal is that the applicant applied out of time.

Koroiveibau’s is one of six test cases put together by Commonwealth Neglected Veterans, a charity run by Esita Tuimanu, a campaigner who has been helped by Dan Jarvis, a Labour MP and former paratrooper. “We hope this is a breakthrough,” she said.

Koroiveibau is due to fly to the UK with the help of the Royal British Legion shortly and he plans to live in Dorset, with a friend, a sergeant in the Scots Guards. A job is being lined up for him as a security guard, Tuimanu added.

Being in Britain means Koroiveibau can freely access the medical treatment he needs – but he is unable to bring his wife and three children to the country because the immigration decision does not apply to them.

Jarvis said it was “only right” that British army veterans could now come back and make the UK their home. But he called for the immigration changes and fee waiver – necessary because so veterans often have little savings and income – to be applied to family members as well.

The Home Office said the service of all members of the armed forces, including Commonwealth nationals, was “highly valued”. A spokesperson added: “All applications are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with the immigration rules.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/12/fijian-british-army-veteran-injured-by-afghan-tour-granted-right-to-settle-test-case-uk
1;Ukraine calls for Patriot missiles to defend its grid and stop rise in refugees;"Ukraine has called for the west to supply Patriot missiles batteries and other modern air defence systems, amid growing concern that attacks by Russia on its electricity grid could prompt a new wave of refugees from the wartorn country.

The country’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, speaking on Monday before a Ukraine humanitarian aid conference the following day in Paris, said Russia wanted “to trigger another wave of migration toward Europe” during the depths of winter.

So far the US has resisted supplying Ukraine with the sophisticated air defence systems, while a recent attempt by Poland to get Germany to deploy a Patriot battery into the country was rejected by Berlin. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also pressed US leader Joe Biden for more help in protecting the country’s battered energy grid in a Sunday night phone call, although he did not publicly specify what weapons he wanted. Waves of Russian attacks since October had destroyed 50% of the network, he added.

“The President also emphasised the importance of capable air defence. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on President Biden to do everything possible to help protect the civilian population of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure,” Kyiv said in its readout of the conversation between the two.

The White House emphasised in its readout that the US had authorised a further $275m of military aid on Friday, including rockets for the Himars artillery system. But the Pentagon has shown no sign of approving the export of Patriots, best known for knocking out Iraqi Scud missiles in the first Gulf war.

On Monday afternoon, Zelenskiy addressed a virtual meeting of G7 leaders, where he warned that Russia “still has the advantage in artillery and missiles” and he called for modern tanks, long-range missiles – and an extra “two billion cubic meters of gas” to make up for shortfalls in electricity supply. But while G7 leaders agreed in a post-meeting statement that there should be “an immediate focus on providing Ukraine with air defence systems and capabilities”, Germany, the holder of the G7 presidency, said specific weapons deliveries to Ukraine were not on the agenda.

Overnight, all non-critical infrastructure in the port city of Odesa was without power. Two people were killed in Russian shelling of the recently liberated city of Kherson, and another two died after a rocket attack on the town of Hirnyk in the Donetsk region, in the east of the country.

In London, former prime minister Boris Johnson took another tack, calling on the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, in the Commons to arm Ukraine with long range ATACMS missiles to “take out” the launch sites of Russian drones and missiles that are currently battering the country’s civilians and its power grid.

Long sought by the Ukrainians, the missiles have a range of up to 300km, but so far the US and its allies, including the UK, have declined to supply them because they could be used to hit targets inside Russia. Supplying them would help “bring the war to an end as soon as possible”, Johnson said.

Wallace did not rule anything out, saying that continued targeting of the electricity grid by Russia may prompt a change of policy: “Should the Russians continue to target civilian areas and try and break those Geneva conventions, then I will be open-minded to seeing what we do next.”

An under pressure electricity network and plunging temperatures are already prompting increased refugee flows out of Ukraine. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said the number of refugees in the country “has risen to some 3 million” after talks with his German counterpart in Berlin.

The head of Norway’s refugee council also predicted that “hundreds of thousands more” will be forced to leave Ukraine. Jan Egeland said he feared “the crisis in Europe will deepen” as the “the horrific and unlawful bombing of civilian infrastructure makes life unliveable in too many places.”

EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed an extra €2bn (?1.7bn) for a fund that has been used to supply Ukraine with weapons, to replenish the European peace facility that was established last year with €5bn.

The €2bn topup was approved despite concerns about Hungary’s “blackmail diplomacy”, after Budapest blocked an €18bn financial aid package for Ukraine last week. Hungary has previously signed off on the EU weapons fund for Ukraine, although it does not allow arms to pass through its territory.

The EU is discussing its ninth round of sanctions against Russia, which include bans on the sale of drones and parts. Officials are concerned that Iranian weapons used in Ukraine, including drones, are being part manufactured in Europe – and it agreed to sanction four Iranian military leaders and four organisations it said were supplying drones to Russia.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/ukraine-calls-for-patriot-missiles-to-defend-its-grid-and-stop-rise-in-refugees
1;Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in the Bahamas as criminal charges loom;"The Bahamas police have arrested former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the country’s attorney general said in a statement on Monday, adding that the Bahamas has received formal notification from the US of criminal charges against him. Bankman-Fried is expected to be extradited to the US, the attorney general’s office for the Bahamas told Reuters, but declined to comment on what the charges were.

In a statement released on Twitter, Damian Williams, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, confirmed Bankman-Fried’s arrest and said the related indictment would be unsealed on Tuesday morning. “[We] will have more to say at that time,” he said.

USA Damian Williams: Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.

— US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) December 12, 2022
The former CEO had been expected on Tuesday to make his first public appearance since FTX’s collapse before US lawmakers. Bankman-Fried, who has been vocal throughout the collapse of FTX on his Twitter account and in public media appearances, was tweeting just hours before his arrest.

Earlier in the day, he had said he would be “calling in” to the hearing before the House financial services committee from the Bahamas. In a Twitter Spaces event on Monday with Twitter account Unusual Whales, Bankman-Fried said it was difficult for him “to move right now and travel because the paparazzi effect is quite large”.

In a statement, Congresswoman Maxine Waters who chairs the committee said she was disappointed Bankman-Fried would not be appearing at the hearing tomorrow.

“Although Mr Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,” she said. “The public has been waiting eagerly to get these answers under oath before Congress, and the timing of this arrest denies the public this opportunity.”

Waters said the committee would still hear from John Ray III, FTX’s new chief executive. Ray, a veteran bankruptcy expert who also oversaw the aftermath of the collapsed energy giant Enron, has called FTX an “unprecedented and complete failure of corporate controls” the likes of which he has not witnessed in his 40-year career. n prepared testimony seen by Reuters, Bankman-Fried said he was pressured into nominating Ray as chief executive in early November by lawyers who were advising his firm at the time. He said shortly thereafter he received a “potential funding offer for billions of dollars to help make customers whole”, but that it was too late to rescind the move.

FTX filed for US bankruptcy protection last month and Bankman-Fried resigned as chief executive, triggering a wave of public demands for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry.

The distressed crypto trading platform struggled to raise money to stave off collapse as traders rushed to withdraw $6bn from the platform in just 72 hours and rival exchange Binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal.

In recent weeks, US authorities have sought information from investors and potential investors in FTX, two sources with knowledge of the requests told Reuters. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also opened probes.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/12/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas-local-authorities-say
1;No year-end press conference for Putin amid Russia’s faltering war in Ukraine;"Vladimir Putin will not hold a year-end press conference for the first time in at least a decade, in what Kremlin-watchers view as a break with protocol due to his war in Ukraine.

The marathon press-conferences are traditionally an occasion for the Russian president to burnish his image, a campy spectacle that allows Putin to play the populist on national television each December.

On Monday, the Kremlin announced it would not be holding the press-conference this year. There would also be no new year reception at the Kremlin, officials said, possibly a decision influenced by the reluctance to celebrate because Russia’s war in Ukraine has not gone to plan.

In previous years, Putin has dedicated much of the event to answering softball questions from adoring local journalists, including some dressed in costume, while batting away any awkward questions from foreign media, allowing his administration to boast about its transparency.

Putin has become far more remote since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and now the destructive war against Ukraine, which has led the Kremlin into international isolation and brought a near-total crackdown on dissenting voices at home.

Putin has disappeared from public for days at a time, sometimes leading to jokes that the Russian leader is hiding in a “bunker”. And his administration is facing tough questions about its strategy for the war, military retreats, mass mobilisation, and reported mistreatment of Russian recruits both on the front and in training.

Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the R.Politik political analysis firm, wrote that Putin was likely to regard the event as a waste of time this year.

“I don’t think that Putin has nothing to say, especially as he’s said so much recently,” she said. “More likely he has a psychological unwillingness to ‘explain himself’, to answer boring and routine questions, to waste time on preparations, play the role of the kind father and so forth.

“For the foreign audience, he can say everything he deems necessary, he’ll find an occasion,” she continued. “As to the domestic audience, he doesn’t see the point. Let his subordinates handle it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/no-year-end-press-conference-for-putin-amid-russias-faltering-war-in-ukraine
1;Ukrainian forces damage key bridge near Melitopol, reports say;"Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged a key bridge outside the southern occupied city of Melitopol, a key objective in the region.

The crossing over the Molochna River is situated between Melitopol and the village of Kostyantynivka just to the east of the city on the M14 highway and was struck overnight.

Video posted online showed two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, with the span partly collapsed by the blast, making it reportedly unusable for heavy military traffic.

An explosion damaged the bridge in occupied Melitopol (Zaporizhzhia Oblast) last night.

Ukrainian Army continues targeting Russian ground lines of communication on the southern front. Melitopol is a key logistics hub that leads to occupied Crimea.

— Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress) December 13, 2022
The strike on the bridge comes just two days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks sited in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties.

The increase in Ukrainian pressure on Russian forces in Melitopol appears to be following a similar pattern to tactics used against Kherson before its liberation, with the targeting of both Russian troops and supply lines, including logistics links to the Crimean peninsula and to the east via the Russia-occupied cities to Berdiansk and Mariupol.

With Ukrainian forces now operating east of the Dnipro River, Melitopol is seen as a key objective for Kyiv in the south of the country after the recapture of Kherson. In the country’s east, where there has been recent heavy fighting around the city of Bakhmut, both Russia and Ukraine said on Tuesday that the situation on the battlefield in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk was difficult, with each claiming some successes in repelling the other’s attacks.

The so-called Donetsk People’s Republic is one of four regions in Ukraine that Moscow proclaimed as its own in September in an exercise Ukraine and its allies denounced as a “sham”, coercive referendum. Advancing in some areas of the region was difficult, the top Moscow-installed official in the occupied parts of the territory in eastern Ukraine said, but they added that more than half of Donetsk was under Russian control.

“A little more than 50% of the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic has been liberated,” Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed administrator of the portion controlled by Moscow, told the Russian state-owned news agency RIA.

Ukraine’s military command said in its daily battlefield update on Tuesday that its forces had repelled Russians in 10 areas of the region.

Russia has claimed to be gradually advancing its positions, with the defence ministry saying on Monday that its offensive there had killed 30 Ukrainian military personnel the day before.

However, independent assessments of Russian gains show little progress in weeks of heavy fighting as Ukraine has moved to shore up its positions ahead of the arrival of full winter conditions on the front.

The latest fighting came as dozens of countries and international organisations threw their weight behind a fresh and urgent push on Tuesday to keep Ukraine powered, fed, warm and moving in the face of sustained Russian aerial bombardments that have plunged millions into the cold and dark in winter.

An international donor conference in Paris raised €1.05bn (?900m) of aid – both financial and in kind – to be rushed to Ukraine in the coming weeks and months to help its beleaguered civilian population survive winter’s freezing temperatures and long nights.  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, in a speech opening the conference, described Moscow’s bombardments of civilian targets as a war crime. He said the Kremlin was attacking civilian infrastructure because its troops had suffered setbacks on the battlefields.

Moscow’s intention is to “plunge the Ukrainian people into despair”, Macron said.

As temperatures plunge and snow falls, Ukraine’s needs are huge and pressing. Successive waves of missile and drone attacks since October have destroyed about half of the country’s energy infrastructure, the government in Kyiv says, and believes Moscow’s intention is to create a fresh wave of refugees flocking to Europe. Russia says striking civilian infrastructure is intended to weaken Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. In Ukraine, life for many is becoming a battle for survival.

To Ukraine’s north, the Belarusian ministry of defence on Tuesday announced a “sudden combat readiness check” of its troops – one in a string of announcements by Belarus, a Russian ally, since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians and disinform Ukraine’s army.

Belarus has not sent forces into Ukraine but it allows Russia to regularly launch missiles from its territory into Ukraine and was one of the key launchpads for Russia’s February attack.

The exercises are mostly taking place in the north-west of the country, close to Poland. Ukraine’s army said its chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, had spoken to his Polish counterpart, Tomas Piotrowski, to discuss the announcement.

Analysts say that a potential attack on Ukraine from the north would probably be aimed at cutting off or disrupting supplies coming in from Poland as well as stretching Ukrainian forces across the country.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/13/ukrainian-forces-damage-key-bridge-near-melitopol-reports-say
1;Scores of executions feared in Iran as 23-year-old hanged in public killing;"Fears are growing that Iran is preparing to execute scores more protesters after authorities hanged a 23-year-old man from a crane, in a public killing carried out less than a month after he was arrested and following a secretive trial.

Majidreza Rahnavard was sentenced to death by a court in the city of Mashhad, a centre of the protests, for allegedly killing two members of the paramilitary Basij force and wounding four others. The Basij, affiliated with the country’s feared Revolutionary Guards, has been at the forefront of the state crackdown.

The pro-government Mizan news agency published a collage of images of Rahnavard hanging from a metal crane, his hands and feet bound, a black bag over his head. Masked security force members stood guard in front of concrete and metal barriers that held back a crowd early on Monday morning.

Rahnavard was not allowed to choose his own lawyer, challenge the evidence against him or ask for the trial to be held in public.

Iranian activist network 1500tasvir said Rahnavard’s mother was allowed to visit him the night before he was hanged. Neither was aware of his imminent execution, according to the group, which posted a photo on Twitter of the two hugging and smiling.

They allowed #MajidRezaRahnavard’s mother to visit him, and didn’t speak of execution at all. She left smiling and hoping that her son would be released soon.

The US state department said the latest killing showed the clerical leadership feared its own people.

“These harsh sentences … are meant to intimidate Iran’s people, they’re meant to suppress dissent and they simply just underscore how much the Iranian leadership actually fears its own people,” state department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters.

Iran has carried out public hangings in the past, most infamously in the 1980s during a mass purge of dissidents and after the disputed 2009 presidential election, but they have become rare in recent years.

State TV showed a video in which Rahnavard said in the court that he came to hate the Basij forces after seeing them beating and killing protesters in videos posted on social media. Activists said he was forced to confess under torture, providing a photo of him with his arm in a sling. An internet blackout and restrictions on reporting make it impossible to corroborate claims out of Iran.

The director of the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, warned that the public execution of a young man so soon after his arrest indicated “a significant escalation of the level of violence against protesters”.

“Rahnavard was sentenced to death based on coerced confessions, after a grossly unfair process and a show trial,” said Amiry-Moghaddam, a leading activist in exile. “This crime must be met with serious consequences for the Islamic republic.”

He said there was “a serious risk of mass execution of protesters” as thousands were in custody.

UN human rights experts estimated that more than 14,000 people have been arrested since rallies first erupted in mid-September over the death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman arrested by the morality police for allegedly wearing her headscarf the wrong way. She left police custody in a coma and died in hospital from severe head wounds.

Iran is already the world’s most prolific user of the death penalty after China, Amnesty International says. The rights group warned this weekend that the lives of two more young men sentenced to death – Mahan Sadrat and Sahand Nourmohammadzadeh – were both at imminent risk.

Two other people were found guilty of offences that carry the death penalty on Monday, adding to the 25 others that Iranian media have said face execution.

Tehran has repeatedly blamed foreign enemies for what it describes as “riots” and accused “terrorists” of killing dozens of security force members in an uprising that represents the biggest challenge to the regime since the shah’s ousting in 1979.

European Union foreign ministers on Monday imposed new sanctions on Iran over the “widespread, brutal and disproportionate” crackdown on anti-government protests, but also its drone deliveries to Russia for its use in the Ukraine war.

The EU “will take any action we can to support young women and peaceful demonstrators”, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said.

The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the sanctions were targeting “in particular those who are responsible for the executions, the violence against innocent people”.

Twenty individuals were sanctioned – having their assets frozen and banned from EU travel – over human rights abuses. Those sanctions are seen as having little impact by Iranian activists, who have called for Europe to begin expelling Iranian diplomats. Activists have also in the past put pressure on companies providing cranes to Iran to halt sales, warning they can be used for executions.

Rahnavard was the second person involved in recent demonstrations to be executed. On Thursday, Iran hanged Mohsen Shekari, who had been convicted of injuring a security guard with a knife and blocking a street in Tehran. During his trial, Shekari showed signs of torture visible on his face, his uncle Mahmoud Shekari said.

His execution over an alleged offence that was non-fatal has raised serious concern over the low bar Tehran is using for capital punishment. One pro-regime legislator, Zohra Elahian, claimed as many as 7,000 security officials had been injured during the demonstrations.

Heartfelt appeals from parents of sons about to face the death penalty have appeared online or in newspapers protesting that their children are innocent and demanding they are given the basic right to a lawyer of their choosing.

Reformists who remain loyal to the idea of the Islamic republic have been warning hardliners for weeks that they need to listen to the protests and respond, or see most of the already alienated population demand the overthrow of the entire post-1979 system.

At least 488 people have been killed since the demonstrations began in mid-September, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been monitoring the protests. Another 18,200 people have been detained by authorities.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/scores-of-executions-feared-in-iran-as-23-year-old-hanged-in-public-execution
0;Three boys dead after falling into icy Solihull lake, police confirm;"Three boys aged eight, 10 and 11 have died after falling through thin ice at a lake near Solihull in the West Midlands.

A fourth boy, aged six, was in a critical condition in hospital after the incident on Sunday afternoon. All four children were in cardiac arrest when they were pulled from the lake at Babbs Mill Park, a nature reserve in Kingshurst.

Emergency crews were initially told six people had been seen on the ice, and recovery search operations continued on Monday.

Members of the public, police officers and firefighters were first to attempt to pull the children to safety, some going into the freezing waters waist-deep. The four boys were then reached by specialist water-rescue trained firefighters.

One police officer had attempted to punch through the ice and had mild hypothermia as a consequence. The boys pulled from the water were given immediate life support by ambulance and fire service personnel before being rushed to two Birmingham hospitals – Birmingham children’s and Heartlands – where they all arrived in critical condition.

At a press conference at the scene on Monday afternoon, Supt Richard Harris said the affected families were “absolutely devastated”, especially because it was so close to Christmas. “We are supporting the families. We have specialist trained officers who are linking in with the families at this time to offer as much support as we can.”

He said the search of the lake would continue but there were no reports of anyone else missing. “We have to be 100% certain that there is no one else possibly in the water at this time. We will be here for as long as it takes.”

Parents everywhere have been urged to remind their children of the dangers of playing on ice.

The area commander of West Midlands fire service, Richard Stanton, said: “The boys’ deaths are a tragedy beyond words. Yesterday’s incident is a stark reminder to us all of the dangers of open water, especially during the winter months. Frozen lakes, ponds, canals and reservoirs can look picturesque, but they can be lethal.

“There are no greater warnings of this than yesterday’s tragic events. We would ask parents and carers to remind their children of the dangers of ice and why they must keep off it. Please help us to avoid this happening again.”

St Anthony’s primary school in Kingshurst, a few minutes’ walk from the park, said it would be closed on Monday because of the incident. It asked for people to keep those affected in their prayers.

Throughout the day, members of the public brought cups of tea and mince pies for the large numbers of emergency services involved in the incident and its aftermath.

Andrea Ansell, 54, who lives nearby, said: “I’ve lived here 28 years and this is the first time anything like this has happened down by that lake. It’s just sadness, but the people and community have been so kind. They’ve been coming down with flowers, organising free McDonald’s deliveries. People are so kind at this really sad time.”

Another local resident said young people had played on the lake in the past, and they called for life rafts to be made available nearby.

Rebecca Prescot, 21, said: “If it happened to my son I would have been devastated. It must be horrendous for the family and friends.” People laid floral tributes. Among them was the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, whose note read: “Such a tragedy. So unnecessary. My heart goes out to the families who have lost their most precious gift. May their young lives rest in peace, and may Kingshurst come together to remember them.”

The newsreader Joanna Gosling fought back tears as she broke the news of the deaths on the BBC shortly after 11am. She had to stop as she read the bulletin. “I’m so sorry, this is terrible news, obviously.”

A number of different agencies across the UK issued warnings about the dangers of playing on ice after incidents. In Cumbria, emergency services and a mountain rescue team were called to a pond in Workington on Sunday after reports of children falling through the ice. A group of boys, including one whose leg had broken through the ice but who did not fall in, were spoken to at the scene.

In York on Monday morning, police said they had encountered “four lads standing on the frozen pond, trying to smash the ice with a scooter. They’ve been suitably advised to give more thought to their life choices.”

Saqib Bhatti, the MP for Meriden, said the local community was close-knit. He said: “Our community is devastated by the heartbreaking news that three young boys have died after falling into Babbs Mill Lake yesterday. I thank our heroic emergency services for everything they have done and the people of Kingshurst who have pulled together at this tragic time.”

Ian Courts and Karen Grinsell, the leader and deputy leader of Solihull council, also praised the bravery of emergency service rescue teams. Courts said: “This is just about as bad as it gets … a dreadful situation. We are completely stunned at what’s happened. Clearly our thoughts and prayers have to be with the families in this situation. I can hardly imagine what the families are going through.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/12/boys-dead-after-falling-into-solihull-lake-police-confirm
0;High court to rule on attempt to ban wild camping on Dartmoor;"On a freezing afternoon underneath the ice-encrusted turrets of the Royal Courts of Justice, about 100 ramblers gathered on Monday to protest for their right to wild camp on Dartmoor.

In a case being heard this week, a wealthy landowner is trying to overturn the legally enshrined right to camp wild in the national park.

The high court will rule on the legal challenge brought by Alexander Darwall, a hedge fund manager and Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, against the national park. Darwall, the owner of the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor, is seeking to remove the public’s right to responsibly wild camp on sections of the moor, which has been permitted since 1985. His moorland estate offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals.

But locals are fighting back. Marking the start of the case being heard in London, dozens of Devon dwellers made their way to the Strand despite the difficult weather conditions.

They are horrified that the last slice of England where it is legal to wild camp could be shut off, with the right to lie under the wide Dartmoor skies potentially eroded forever.

Dan Pritchard and Rebecca Shaw live a half-hour drive from the Blachford estate, and have been Dartmoor residents for 15 years.

“We wild camp, and all our children have too,” Shaw said. “They’ve camped on the moor as teenagers, we moved there for the wilderness, I wanted to bring up my children in the little piece of wilderness left in southern England. Adventure and freedom is hard to find in England now, so it’s difficult to think that a part of it could be taken away.”

Pritchard added: “The right to wild camp is built into the community. Everyone in our community wild camps at some point on the moor, and from scout groups to dog walkers the right to roam is part of life on Dartmoor. If you look back through history there have always been these battles between landowners and people who use the land. We didn’t lose our right to roam all in one go – it was taken little by little.”

Dartmoor is the only place in England and Wales where it is legal to wild camp in designated areas, without a landowner’s permission. While all the land in the national park is in private hands, local farmers, known as commoners, have long had rights to graze their livestock on unenclosed parts of the moor. People have also camped in these areas for at least 100 years, and bylaws brought in under the Dartmoor Commons Act in the mid-1980s enshrined it as a right.

Papers lodged by the Darwalls’ lawyers in the high court assert that the right of access granted by the Dartmoor Commons Act “does not include a right of wild camping”. The estate is seeking a declaration that “members of the public are not entitled … to pitch tents or otherwise occupy Stall Moor overnight … except with the claimant’s consent”. The document says currently the Darwalls “cannot effectively enforce their rights against members of the public” as campers would rely on Dartmoor’s bylaws “if sued by the [Darwalls]”. If they win the case, campaigners fear it would overturn the right to wild camp on the whole of Dartmoor. So, they have been making their voice heard, taking part in wild camping protests and rallies – and making a scene outside the high court.

Outside the court, the protesters shouted: “Dartmoor is for everyone,” danced to music from a samba band and listened to a performance by the folk musician Sam Lee.

Supporting the protest was the Green MP Caroline Lucas, who recently tabled a private member’s bill asking for a wider right to roam, in woodlands and on common land. Currently, there is a right to roam on only 8% of England.

She told the protesters: “Thank you to all of you here for standing up for the right of access. The land is ours and I am so proud to be standing in solidarity with you and in solidarity against this greed and rapaciousness of the wealthy landowning elite who are trying to shut us out from what belongs to us. So I just want to say that there are some members of parliament who are with you on this and will be following this case incredibly closely.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/12/high-court-to-rule-on-attempt-to-ban-wild-camping-on-dartmoor
1;‘We are built differently’: Croatia relish second shot at World Cup glory;"It is quite a ridiculous idea. To come to the World Cup, four years after making it to the final as one of the best underdog success stories in the tournament’s history, thinking you could go one step further this time and win the whole thing. This is football after all, the No 1 global sport, not handball or water polo, the other two team sports at which Croatia are any good.

In those two sports the competition is much narrower and you also get a chance to win the world championship every year. It is not the Davis Cup either, which they have managed to win twice in the past 17 years, with two different generations of players. If you are a small nation, the best you can normally hope for in football is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play in the World Cup semi-finals or final. Many good teams from much bigger nations never get that opportunity, but here we are in 2022 with Croatia poised to play in their third semi-final in less than a quarter of a century. What’s more, they are not satisfied yet. “In 2018 we wrote history, but now we want to repeat that,” the captain, Luka Modric, told Marca after beating Brazil on penalties in the quarter-finals. “I hope we can make that extra step this time.”

Mateo Kovacic, his playmaking partner in midfield, was even more direct: “We came here wanting to stay until the end,” he told HRT, the Croatian national broadcaster. “That was our goal from the start and nothing is done yet. We’ll do our best to achieve even greater things.”

They are all thinking it. The coach, Zlatko Dalic, has never got over the defeat against France in the 2018 final, always believing this team can do the impossible and convincing the players to share his belief. And now, having made it this far, they are ready to speak their minds: yes, they came here to win the World Cup. But football, as we’ve known it all our lives, doesn’t work like that. Their success four years ago was already a freakish occurrence – never has such an outsider, the darkest of horses, reached the final, at least not in the modern age. The World Cup final is reserved for football superpowers and only those can hope for a second chance if they lose it. And yet Croatia, a nation of less than 4 million, is one step away from getting it.

What is a football superpower these days, anyway? Is it Argentina, who lost 3-0 against Croatia in Russia four years ago? Is it France, whom Croatia defeated 1-0 in Saint-Denis just six months ago to finish top of their Nations League group? Brazil? Already home. Germany? Ditto. Given the results in recent years, maybe the Vatreni should now be considered – dare we say it? – a football superpower of our times. If so, they are a very special one. They have now played six knockout games in the past two World Cup tournaments without winning any of them in 90 minutes. Four of those went to penalties and every time they emerged victorious from the shootout. Every single time their opponent first took the lead – including the 2-1 extra time win against England in the 2018 semi-finals – only to be followed by a Croatia comeback. In Qatar, they have beaten only Canada so far, and that was after going behind early in the game. They have scored only twice in their other four matches and yet they remain unbeaten, unlike Argentina or France. Maybe they can’t beat you, but they will also make it very, very hard for you to beat them. And the Argentinians better not take the lead against Croatia – if they do, they could be in serious trouble. How do they do it? That is the question everyone is asking, but no one yet has offered a legitimate answer. Where does this exceptional mental strength come from? There are many theories flying around, many of them dealing with the esoteric, and you are tempted to go with some of them until you realise they can only explain why they are good – but not why they are this good. After all, this is a nation where often the only thing that feels organised is crime, with domestic football and everything around it particularly corrupt, and yet these players somehow find the way to stay among the world’s best.

“We are built differently,” tweeted Ivan Ljubicic, who won the 2005 Davis Cup with Croatia and later coached Roger Federer, after the Vatreni’s win against Brazil. Yeah, let’s go with that, the Croatians shrugged, it’s an explanation as good as any.

Because the Vatreni and their fans are not looking for explanations. They are looking for two more wins.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/13/we-are-built-differently-croatia-relish-second-shot-at-world-cup-glory
0;Daryl Dike strikes late to complete West Brom’s comeback win at Sunderland;"West Brom’s substitutes came up trumps as second-half goals from Tom Rogic and Daryl Dike secured a 2-1 victory over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.

Sunderland claimed a first-half lead when Amad Diallo scored from the penalty spot, but Albion’s manager Carlos Corber?n made a host of second-half changes, throwing on both Rogic and Dike in an attempt to change things.

Rogic levelled when he fired home from the edge of the area and Dike headed home a West Brom winner from Jed Wallace’s 83rd-minute cross. Corber?n was understandably delighted with the impact of his substitutes. “We need to see when things need to change and the response of the substitutes was fantastic. That is what you need to win a game. We have a good squad and, when we bring players on from the bench, they have to have that kind of impact.”

Dike was playing in just his third match of the season after suffering a thigh injury and Corber?n is delighted to see the American back in full training and fighting for a place in the starting XI.

He said: “He is training normally with the group and, now he is having the game time, that is going to help him.

“Of course, every striker wants to score and he will have confidence now he has got that goal. But, for me, the fact he is training fully with the rest of the group is the most important thing for him.”

Sunderland were ahead inside the opening 20 minutes, with Amad claiming his fifth goal in the last seven matches from the spot. The Manchester United loanee won the spot-kick himself via a slick one-two with Luke O’Nien that resulted in West Brom full-back Conor Townsend bundling him over from behind.

With Sunderland’s regular penalty taker, Ross Stewart, still feeling his way back from a long-term injury, Amad stepped up to confidently stroke his effort home.

The Black Cats almost scored a second two minutes after breaking the deadlock, but, while Ellis Simms’ flick released Alex Pritchard into the penalty area, Albion goalkeeper Alex Palmer was off his line quickly to save the midfielder’s shot. Danny Batth conceded possession to John Swift deep inside his own half and reacted by pulling back the Baggies forward. Swift and his teammates demanded a straight red card, but referee James Linington opted to show a yellow.

The visitors came close to claiming an equaliser eight minutes into the second half when Matty Phillips met Swift’s low cross but Sunderland goalkeeper Anthony Patterson denied him with a point-blank save.

Patterson tipped Rogic’s long-range strike over the crossbar as West Brom continued to press, but the Sunderland goalkeeper was unable to prevent the equaliser with 20 minutes left. Wallace’s cross was cleared into Rogic’s path and the Australian prodded home a first-time effort from the edge of the 18-yard box.

West Brom scored their second with seven minutes left thanks to another of their substitutes. Wallace swung over a cross from close to the right touchline and the onrushing Dike powerfully headed home.

Disappointed Sunderland manager Tony Mowbray said afterwards: “We sat too deep and invited pressure. This team at this stadium need to play on the front foot and yet it’s a human thing really to protect what you’ve got sometimes. It’s a frustrating night for us.” ";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/12/daryl-dike-strikes-late-to-complete-west-broms-comeback-win-at-sunderland
1;‘I like big games’: Dominik Livakovic fired up to be Croatia’s hero again;"On the eve of Croatia’s crucial World Cup qualifier against Russia last November, Luka Modric sat down with Dominik Livakovic for a chat. The Dinamo Zagreb goalkeeper had lost his place to Ivo Grbic after being blamed for mistakes in the 2-2 home draw against Slovakia a few weeks earlier that jeopardised his country’s chances of securing a place in Qatar. “I wouldn’t be telling you this if I didn’t care about you but I see that you are not progressing with the national team,” Modric tells Livakovic in a conversation that was captured during the Netflix documentary, Captains.

“Maybe it’s the pressure you’re under, maybe it’s not … but you’re radiating uncertainty and that rubs off on the team. Do you understand? Why can’t you make a mistake? We all make mistakes. I feel that your problem is that you’re afraid of making them … name one person who doesn’t make mistakes. I didn’t get to where I am by being scared, it only makes things worse. Look, you’re a great goalkeeper. You know that, right?” Modric’s approach has certainly paid dividends. Little more than 12 months since that conversation in a hotel lobby, man-of-the-match performances against Japan and Brazil at the 2022 World Cup transformed Livakovic into an instant hero in Croatia. The 27-year-old became only the third goalkeeper in history to save three penalties in a World Cup shootout in the last-16 victory against Japan, following in the footsteps of Portugal’s Ricardo against England in 2006 and fellow Croatian Danijel Subasic against Denmark at Russia 2018 – who, like Livakovic, was born in Zadar.

“I never thought about it possibly being my last game for Croatia, because when it went to penalties I told everyone that Livakovic would save them,” Modric said after watching that victory from the bench having been substituted. Livakovic said: “My whole life in football flashed before my eyes before the first penalty, emotions that I’ll definitely never forget.”

But things would get even better for him against Brazil. Eleven saves during normal time was the most recorded by a goalkeeper since 2014, when USA’s Tim Howard made 16 saves against Belgium in the last 16. Then his stop to deny Real Madrid’s Rodrygo from the spot led to Livakovic joining Argentina’s Sergio Goycochea, Germany’s Harald Schumacher and Subasic as the only goalkeepers in World Cup history to make four shootout saves. “He was there to do what he’s supposed to do, he saved the first penalty and gave us confidence and less confidence for Brazil because they were afraid he’d save again,” the coach Zlatko Dalic said. “He made the difference for us over the whole match.”

The softly spoken Livakovic also excelled at volleyball and basketball in his youth and briefly studied diplomacy and international relations at Zagreb university before joining Dinamo in 2015. “I’m putting it aside while I’m playing football, but I want to do it one day,” he said in an interview in 2019. “And my family is perhaps not sorry these days that I chose the ball instead of the book …”

Livakovic – the son of Zdravko Livakovic, a former state secretary of Croatia’s ministry of transport – made his debut for Dinamo’s first team in October 2017 having previously played for amateur side NK Zagreb. Two years later, he broke a record that had stood for more than 20 years for most minutes from the start of Dinamo’s season without conceding a goal.

Modric was not the only Real Madrid legend who spotted his ability at an early stage. “This year I have followed Dominik Livakovic,” tweeted Iker Casillas in April 2019. “He plays for Dinamo Zagreb. 24 years old. Interesting.” Casillas is one of Livakovic’s idols and the former Spain goalkeeper and 2010 World Cup winner again showed his appreciation after the victory against Brazil with the tweet: “Dominik Livakovic, PORTERO [goalkeeper].”

Livakovic was Subasic’s deputy at the 2018 World Cup as Croatia made it all the way to the final in Russia before losing to France. “Everything was particularly emotional,” he said in an interview a few months later. “Apart from the result, which is the biggest in the history of Croatian football, the emotions that stuck in my memory the most during the last World Cup in Russia were the moments when our passage depended on penalties. It’s something that can hardly be described in words: I was yelling, laughing and crying at the same time.” Now Argentina and Lionel Messi stand in the way of Croatia emulating the class of 2018 when they meet in Tuesday’s semi-final. Only this time they will have to get past Livakovic. “Honestly, I like playing big matches, that adrenaline and the atmosphere that can be felt in the air. That’s when I have the highest concentration.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/13/dominik-livakovic-ready-to-repeat-heroics-against-argentina-world-cup
0;Angelo Badalamenti, David Lynch’s composer on Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and more, dies aged 85;"Angelo Badalamenti, the acclaimed composer who created haunting music for David Lynch projects including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive, has died at the age of 85.

Badalamenti died on Sunday of natural causes, surrounded by family at his New Jersey home, his niece told the Hollywood Reporter.

Lynch and Badalamenti would become close friends and collaborators, working together on Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway, The Straight Story and Mulholland Drive. Badalamenti also appeared on screen as the coffee-loving gangster Luigi Castigliane in Mulholland Drive, and played piano with Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet.

The classically trained musician also worked with the likes of Nina Simone, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, Shirley Bassey, Marianne Faithfull, Liza Minnelli, Pet Shop Boys and LL Cool J over his varied career, and composed themes including Inside the Actors Studio and the torch theme for the 1992 Olympic Games.

On 1986’s Blue Velvet, his first collaboration with Lynch, he was brought in to work as a vocal coach for Rossellini. Lynch asked him to write a tune for the score, saying “let it float like the tides of the ocean, make it collect space and time, timeless and endless”, which became the song Mysteries of Love, performed by Julee Cruise. Eventually Lynch tasked him with writing the film’s score, asking for Badalamenti to be “like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary”.

Badalamenti wrote the music for most of Twin Peaks without having seen any of the footage. In 2018, Badalamenti recalled writing Laura Palmer’s Theme with Lynch: “David came to my little office across from Carnegie Hall and said, ‘I have this idea for a show, ‘Northwest Passage’ … he sat next to me at the keyboard and said, ‘I haven’t shot anything, but it’s like you are in a dark woods with an owl in the background and a cloud over the moon and sycamore trees are blowing very gently’ … he said, ‘A beautiful troubled girl is coming out of the woods, walking toward the camera …’ I played the sounds he inspired.

“The notes just came out. David was stunned, as was I. The hair on his arms was up and he had tears in his eyes: ‘I see Twin Peaks. I got it.’ I said, ‘I’ll go home and work on it.’ ‘Work on it?! Don’t change a note.’ And of course I never did.” Badalamenti would receive a Grammy award and three Emmy nominations for his work on Twin Peaks, and the soundtrack went gold in 25 countries.

He would sometimes visit Lynch’s sets to play music live during filming so the actors “could feel the mood”. His intuition for reading atmosphere was of great inspiration to the film-maker, who told the New York Times in 2005: “I sit with Angelo and talk to him about a scene and he begins to play those words on the piano … when we started working together, we had an instant kind of a rapport – me not knowing anything about music but real interested in mood and sound effects. I realised a lot of things about sound effects and music working with Angelo, how close they are to one another.”

Born in Brooklyn in 1937, Badalamenti played piano and French horn as a teenager before heading to music school on a full scholarship. He graduated from the Manhattan School of Music in 1960. During college breaks, he would accompany performers at resorts in the Catskill Mountains. “I had to play a lot of the standards, so I learned quite a wide range of music,” he said in 2019. “I had to learn them very quickly, and learning so many different types of music was a tremendous help later on in my career.”

He eventually landed a job at a music publisher, which saw him write songs for artists including Shirley Bassey and Nina Simone, under the pen name Andy Badale. His first film score was for 1973’s Gordon’s War. His third film score was 1986’s Blue Velvet. Badalamenti, Lynch and Cruise put out two albums, 1989’s Floating into the Night and 1993’s The Voice of Love. He and Lynch also recorded a jazz album, Thought Gang, in the early 1990s, which wasn’t released for another two decades.

He would later work with Paul Schrader on The Comfort of Strangers, Forever Mine, Auto Focus and Dominion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet on The City of Lost Children and A Very Long Engagement, Jane Campion on Holy Smoke, Danny Boyle on The Beach and Eli Roth on Cabin Fever.

His music was used in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, Secretary, the 2006 remake of The Wicker Man and A Late Quartet.

Badalamenti received a lifetime achievement award at the 2008 World Soundtrack Awards, and the prestigious Henry Mancini award in 2011, which was presented to him by Lynch.

0;Best films of 2022 in the UK: No 9 – Memoria;Awoman awakes to an eerie cacophony of car alarms apparently triggered by a loud boom. Is it gunfire, or a break-in? Where are we? And who is the woman who inhabits this supremely dislocated world? The simple answer is that she is Jessica, a market gardener who grows orchids in the Colombian city of Medell?n but is currently in Bogot? to be at her sister’s hospital bedside, from which she views the mountainous countryside through a crack in the curtains. But nothing is as it seems in this slow-drawing film from Thai artist and film-maker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, which spools out like one of the auditory hallucinations from which Tilda Swinton’s scrupulously introverted Jessica suffers. By slowing the camera down to a glacial speed, Weerasethakul compels viewers to become listeners: the scrape of a chair across a floor, a backfiring bus, a loud thud as a stray dog wanders across a square, and the recurrent thrum of heavy rainfall: all appear to tell ominous stories that are dreamlike and rooted in reality. In her search for a physical representation of the sound only she can hear, Jessica visits a recording studio where, with the help of an earnest young sound engineer, Hern?n (Juan Pablo Urrego), who turns out not to exist, she settles on one described as “body hits duvet hits wood bat”. Typically of this film, body, duvet and wood bat are all commonplace objects but the grammar of their combination makes a surreal sort of poetry. You can feel it without having any idea what it means. The understory is of historic trauma buried deep in the lushly forested Amazon landscape. Ancient skeletons with holes drilled in their skulls are being mechanically excavated from tunnels in the mountains. The most articulate character turns out to be a peasant with total recall, also called Hern?n, who scales fish for a living, and listens in to the stories of stones. He gently berates Jessica for crying over memories that are not her own, but this isn’t a glib story of cultural appropriation. For this older Hern?n (Elkin D?az), sleep is a little death: lying down on the riverbank, with eyes open as if dead, he demonstrates how he screens out the cries of the past, even as he tunes into them. But it’s the landscape itself that has the last word in an audacious finale, in which the hills heave into science-fictional life. Everyone who has stayed the distance will find their own meaning in this. To me it suggests that, with hands joined across a kitchen table, Jessica and Hern?n become a portal to a quantum reality that belongs simultaneously to nobody and to everyone who ever has, and ever will have, lived.;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-9-memoria
0;‘Cultural appropriation’: discussion builds over western yoga industry;"Yoga has been a big part of Nadia Gilani’s life since she was introduced to the practice by her mother at the age of 16. A few years ago, after various personal struggles, she became a full-time yoga teacher. But almost immediately, she realised not only were most yoga teachers and students in the UK white, but the accompanying wellness narrative has divorced yoga from its 5,000-year-old roots.

“The lack of people of colour in the industry is a massive problem,” Gilani said. “There is a big issue with diversity, in terms of both teachers and those who practice it. What especially annoys me is when Sanskrit words like ‘namaste’ get emblazoned on T-shirts, images of Hindu gods are turned into tattoos, or ‘om’ symbols are printed on yoga mats. It’s cultural appropriation and it’s offensive.”

If her mother had not introduced her to yoga, Gilani wonders if she would have found it at all. “Flashy studios, costing up to ?20 a class. It’s gatekeeping, in a way.”

This week, practitioners in India have once again sought to draw attention to what they see as cultural appropriation of yoga, amid allegations it has been whitewashed. Vikram Jeet Singh, a yoga instructor in Goa, told This Week in Asia that “his own culture” has been “wiped out and suppressed by colonisation”.

In the west, he added, yoga has “become synonymous with a workout session stripped of any kind of cultural background, where you have to show up with $100 Lululemon leggings and an equally expensive mat. That is not right”.

Yoga has developed from an underground practice to a multibillion-pound industry driven by celebrity fans such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. In 2019, the global yoga industry was worth an estimated $37.46bn (?30.53bn). Teachers of South Asian heritage in the UK, such as Nikita Desai, have posted videos claiming yoga has become “colonised” and inaccessible to many, the Times has reported. Online teacher Cat Meffan said she had to learn about issues around appropriation, which was not taught when she studied to be a teacher in 2014.

In her book The Yoga Manifesto: How Yoga Helped Me and Why it Needs to Save Itself, Gilani writes at length about the problems in the industry. But she said she did not like words such as “colonised” to describe the spread of the yogic practice.

“I don’t think claiming yoga back as an Indian practice for only Indians is the way,” she said. “These conversations have to be nuanced. It’s not as simple as saying ‘the west has nicked yoga’.

“I was born in the west, I’ve got a western practice and I’ve got a western modern life, which is why I think the call to ‘decolonise’ doesn’t quite work. I need my practice to fit with my modern life. Of course, I’m more sensitive because I had to deal with growing up as a person of colour in the west. But this isn’t about bashing white people – everyone has to be sensitive.

Christmas can feel expensive, but adding a touch of festive cheer to your decor doesn’t have to leave you strapped for cash. With many of us tightening our belts – this year more than most – we asked interiors Instagrammers, experts and creatives to share their ideas for bringing some ho-ho-ho into your home without breaking the bank.

Marbled baubles
Zeena Shah, art director, stylist and author of Marbling
Marbling is a brilliant, budget-friendly way to zhoosh up your Christmas decor. I love to use it to upcycle old Christmas baubles but you can buy inexpensive glass ones, too. Pour room-temperature water into a deep bowl until it’s two-thirds full. Drop a small amount of nail polish or marbling ink in two or three colours into the water until a pattern forms. Swirl the colours – but work quickly, as nail polish dries within a minute or two – then dip baubles into the mixture for a beautiful marbled pattern. Hang to dry and spray with a clear matt varnish to ensure they last for years.

Printed place settings
Ellie Edwards, printmaker The joy of printmaking is that it’s a very flexible medium – there are so many ways to create prints with materials you already have around the house. Get creative with leftover vegetables – the more textured, the better – by using red cabbage or brussels sprouts sliced in half to reveal a flat surface. Coat this flat surface in a thin layer of acrylic paint, then press down on to paper. Peel the paper away to reveal vibrant art. Use your prints as place settings for the table, cut a hole and hang them from the tree, or write the festive menu on the other side.

Paper snowflakes
Zack Mclaughlin, paper artist I love making paper snowflakes – you can use wallpaper, wrapping paper or even printer paper. Fold a piece of A4 in half, then tear it along the fold line. Use a paper creaser (or the blunt side of a knife) and a ruler to score straight lines along the length of both halves (use the ruler as a width guide). Next, fold both sheets of now-scored paper in half lengthways, then unfold. Using all of your scored lines, fold both sheets like a concertina. With scissors, cut the ends of your folded sheets into triangles, then fold in half and use string to tie both folded sheets together at the centre. Close all gaps in the snowflake with double-sided tape. Tie a hoop in the end of your string for hanging et voil?: you have a stunning paper snowflake.

Cloth-wrapped gifts
Tomoko Kakita, architectural and interior designer, founder of ma space design and author of Furoshiki and the Japanese Art of Gift Wrapping Furoshiki is a traditional Japanese method of wrapping using a square piece of cloth. To decorate your home in the festive season, use it to wrap gifts – or any object – and place under your tree. Start by putting a square piece of fabric on the diagonal, design side down, and place the object you wish to wrap in the centre, but above an imaginary line connecting the left and right corners. Bring the bottom corner up to the top, to make a triangle (with your object inside). Roll the object up, then bring the top point over and tuck (to hide the point itself). Bring the left and right corners over the top, towards each other, and tie together neatly.

Foraged wreaths
Bex Partridge, dried-flower artist When it comes to wreaths, there is no need for them to cost the earth. Beech leaves (keep an eye out for the crinkled bronze ones), bracken, holly berries, structural seed heads and fluffy old man’s beard are all around at the moment and perfect for foraging. You will need a circular base – use vines or even a wire coat hanger, unwound and made into a circle – as well as a spool of thin-gauge wire or string. Attach your wire or string to your wreath base and begin to add in your foraged stems, securing each one by wrapping the wire or string around them. Work your way around the wreath base until it is covered. Then hang. If a tree is beyond your means this year, a windfallen branch hung with ribbon from a wall can be decorated with a few cheap baubles and still add some festive cheer.

Printed wrapping paper
Molly Mahon, block printer and author of House of Print There are countless ways to create Christmas decor on a budget. I buy rolls of inexpensive recycled brown paper and go to town printing bunting, paper chains and wrapping paper. If you don’t have a wooden printing block you could just as easily use a potato. For cheap paint, use leftover sample pots. Start by cutting your potato in half to create a flat surface. Mark the shape you want using a pencil or a biscuit cutter: I find simple shapes create the most striking prints. Cut away the excess potato around your shape, then put a thick layer of paint on to the raised area and press it on the paper. Each time you make a print, load your potato with more paint. There is nothing more heartfelt than a hand-printed wrap, jaunty homemade decoration or even a simple printed card.

Handwritten menus
Kirthanaa Naidu, tablescape stylist
If you’re hosting Christmas dinner, I always recommend a white linen tablecloth – you can find relatively cheap deadstock on eBay. Build up from that. It doesn’t matter if your crockery doesn’t match – mix-and-match can look cool – or, if you’ve got classic white Ikea plates, disguise them with colourful napkins picked up on Etsy or eBay. A handwritten menu placed on top looks like you’ve made a lot of effort when in fact it’s easy to put together. You can either buy menu cards from Papier or make your own – textured paper is really beautiful.

Decorate the centre of the table with foraged greenery or, if you have a tree, clippings from the back. To make your table a sensory experience, supermarket herbs can be placed in glasses or bud vases. Rosemary and thyme smell nice and will complement the food. I also like to add bunches of grapes or cranberries.

I always recommend candles on a festive table. Glass holders can be bought from charity shops or you could use fruits such as clementines and oranges. It will work best if your candle is thin and made of beeswax – paraffin isn’t so nice to breathe while you’re eating.

Festive paper chains
Fee Greening, illustrator I love a jolly cutout paper chain. I use brown parcel paper and roughly paint with long dry brush strokes, so the brown still peeks through. I tend to stick to dark brown, fiery red and olive colours. Once it’s dry, cut a long strip, about 15cm tall. Fold the strip back and forth like an accordion, wide enough to accommodate your design: you can start with a simple pine tree or star. I usually go for running animals, reindeer, hares or fluttering birds. Draw the silhouette on to the top layer – it needs an element that joins on to its neighbour: so if you are drawing a bird, for example, a beak could connect to the next bird’s wing. Then cut out your chosen shape. I leave the paper chains as elegant silhouettes for a few days and then, when my younger relatives visit, we paint on smiling faces, feathers, the whole caboodle.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/12/make-your-own-decorations-eight-cheap-easy-and-classy-looking-projects-to-make-this-a-bright-christmas
0;The Guardian view on Sunak’s strikes: to be more inflexible than Thatcher is a flaw Editorial;"Rishi Sunak sees himself as heir to Margaret Thatcher – but in dealing with December’s strikes, which version of the former prime minister does he want to be? Mrs Thatcher was an ideologue who claimed the backlash against the “winter of discontent” in 1978-79 represented a “sea change” in public opinion and a mandate to “clip the wings” of trade unions. But she was also a pragmatist who in 1979 gave public sector workers a 25% pay rise – roughly double the rate of inflation and more than the 19% received by private sector workers – to avert a second successive “winter of discontent”. Mr Sunak’s tribute act prefers ideological posturing to practical solutions: proposing new anti-strike laws that the Lords won’t pass as he has no electoral mandate to enact them; and doubling down on pay restraint for key workers. This strategy is disastrous for the public sector – leading to falling recruitment, worsening services and escalating industrial strife. The prime minister is out of touch with a nation growing restive over the unreliability and increasing dereliction of state-financed services. Millions of underpaid Britons struggling with a growing cost of living crisis seem, for now, empathetic towards rolling strikes from NHS, post and rail workers, as well as planned action by teachers and border force staff.

When ministers scupper a railway deal the unions might accept, they cannot claim to be neutral. It is disingenuous to say, as the government does, that state employees’ pay is a matter for independent review bodies – when their remit is set by ministers who effectively rig the outcome by casting awards on their terms. The result is that the biggest falls in real wages are those of public sector workers, and those in sectors where the government sits behind employers, such as the railways.

It would be unsustainable in normal times for private sector pay to grow by almost 7% a year while in the public sector pay is rising by just 2%. It is indefensible when inflation is in double figures. Allowing public sector pay to catch up is not inflationary, nor will it spark a wage-price spiral. In Scotland, an offer of a 7.5% rise to nurses, some way below that sought by the unions, was enough to avoid strike action. Ministers settled the criminal barristers’ strike with a 15% fee increase. Negotiations can end disputes but ministers won’t sit down with unions to talk money, preferring to call up the army – and let strikes go ahead so that workers can be blamed by those inconvenienced.

Public sector workers are demanding pay rises to match inflation, arguing that they’re seeing real-terms pay cuts after more than a decade of restraint. Ben Zaranko from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks this would cost the Treasury about ?15bn. Mr Sunak won’t spend the cash. This is not because of adverse market reaction or because the country can’t afford it. It’s because the prime minister’s most notable achievement is to make austerity respectable in his party again, even if the electorate is unconvinced. His sleight of hand is to defend his book-balancing policies to voters by claiming public expenditure has been kept level in cash terms while shrinking the state by 10% in real terms to appease Conservative MPs.

Mr Sunak’s policies have either been irrelevant to the needs of the country, or harmful to its economy. It is dishonest to claim public services won’t be damaged by using rising prices to squeeze budgets and erode staff wages. Mr Sunak should emulate Mrs Thatcher’s realism and offer inflation-proof pay awards to bring industrial action to an end. Otherwise, the country will hold him responsible for what is likely to be not just a winter but a year of discontent.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/12/the-guardian-view-on-sunaks-strikes-to-be-more-inflexible-than-thatcher-is-a-flaw
0;Anthony Albanese’s latest plan to subsidise foreign coal and gas companies is just absurd Richard Denniss;"Just as a fish can’t taste the water it swims in, it is hard for Australians to notice how bizarre our climate and energy policy debates have become. We have seemingly abandoned economics, climate science and even opinion polling when it comes to identifying options for reform. The only way forward is what the fossil fuel industry tells us to do. Imagine if we had taken that approach to tobacco control. Think I’m exaggerating? Well, before I try to explain the absurdity of the Albanese government’s latest plan to subsidise the coal and gas industries, let’s take a quick tour of the climate and energy policy options that dare not speak their name. Carbon taxes give a competitive advantage to energy generators that produce less carbon pollution and give individuals and companies an incentive to change their behaviour. And get this, they generate revenue for the government as well. In 2013-14 the Australian carbon price raised $7.3bn before being scrapped by the Abbott government. This is revenue governments can use to help individuals or companies cope with higher energy prices or invest in energy saving technology. New Zealand has a carbon tax, as do Europe and California. Needless to say, the sky didn’t fall down nor did their economies didn’t collapse, but they did manage to reduce their fossil fuel use and grow their economies just as Australia did between 2012 and 2014.

Fossil fuel subsidies are a stupid idea, unless you want more fossil fuels. Australia spends around $11bn a year on them. On top of that, Laborhas committed $1.9bn to the Northern Territory’s Middle Arm Petrochemical plant which will convert fracked gas from the Betaloo Basin into gas for export, fertiliser and plastics. Not only are there 114 new gas projects and coalmines seeking approval in Australia, the government is subsiding the construction of factories that will use those fossil fuels. We aren’t so much decarbonising our economy as turbocharging its carbon intensity. The government’s own projections show that fugitive emissions from fossil fuels are set to increase to 2030. How does the government propose to address this? With carbon offsets. Mostly from trees and soil. To be clear, carbon offsets don’t decarbonise the economy and the risk with trees is that they are increasingly burning down as the climate crisis intensifies.

After decades of research showing the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to tax fossil fuels and subsidise renewables, Australian governments are still fixated on “sequestering” all the carbon pollution from our existing and planned new fossil fuel projects. Indeed, the Climate Change Authority, chaired by former gas executive, Grant King, recently “self-initiated” research into how many millions of tonnes of carbon can be stored in trees and underground. The CCA is silent on Australia’s fossil fuel expansion, but has released three reports since the election that promote offsets. Talk about not mentioning the war. Advocates of carbon credits instead of carbon taxes claim to want climate ambition but systematically ignore the fact that most carbon credits are a “sham”. They are also notably silent on the way carbon credits are being used to justify new fossil fuel projects, demonstrating the power of the fossil fuel industry. If we were serious about reducing emissions, we would want to both sequester carbon and stop new sources being built. It’s no coincidence that since polluters can simply buy “carbon credits”, investment in solar, wind and batteries is at a five-year low.

Windfall profits taxes work. Australia is the worlds’s third-largest exporter of fossil fuels and, as such, the companies that sell our fossil fuels are making enormous profits off the back of the surging prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But while Saudi citizens aren’t struggling with how to cope with high oil prices and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund managed to salt away an extra $42bn last year, our policy settings so outrageously favour the fossil fuel industry that ordinary Australians are struggling with higher petrol, gas and electricity prices while the foreign-owned fossil fuel companies are struggling to believe how little Australian tax they pay. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prize-winning economist says a windfall profits tax in Australia is a “no brainer”, yet our political class is determined to pretend it is a bad idea. Which brings me to the latest plan to cap some coal and gas prices at what are still bumper prices and for Australian taxpayers to “compensate” the foreign fossil fuel companies for interrupting their profiteering.

To be clear, what we should do is scrap the $11bn a year we spend on fossil fuel subsidies, impose a carbon tax like the successful one we had in 2012 to 2014 and stop wasting money on dodgy carbon offsets. We could give that extra money to low-income earners, invest in renewables, decarbonise the economy and still cut the budget deficit.

The UN secretary general, Ant?nio Guterres, says the world needs to “end our global addiction to fossil fuels” yet Australia is not only planning a massive expansion of coal and gas, it’s planning to subsidise that expansion while providing a nice big blanket of state-sanctioned greenwash. The weirdest thing of all is not how backwards our policies have become, but the threats polluters make to get their way. Apparently if we started to tax them they would stop building new coal and gas projects … which is of course, what tackling climate change would look like. Needless to say, we cant talk about that.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/14/anthony-albaneses-latest-plan-to-subsidise-foreign-coal-and-gas-companies-is-just-absurd
0;Selfridges boss Anne Pitcher: ‘The high street is a tragedy’ Sarah Butler;"The queen of department stores is hanging up her crown. In her trademark shiny bob, worn with an immaculate designer outfit and chunky jewellery, Anne Pitcher, the boss of Selfridges, has just a few weeks left in the job after more than 40 years stalking the shop floor.

She is exiting stage left just months after the upmarket department store changed hands, but Pitcher insists this is not because department stores are in their death throes. She is, after all, off to help run the department store chain of Selfridges’ former owner, Canadian firm Holt Renfrew.

“Physical department stores will not be dying out, not on my watch,” she says. “Every time you look, something else is there to attack the original department store model, so we must continue to reinvent.”

Sitting in her luxurious office above Selfridges’ Oxford Street store, Pitcher says the cost of living crisis will touch everyone, even well-heeled Selfridges customers. But she adds that tourists are now flooding back to London after Covid, helping bump sales at the flagship store above pre-pandemic levels: “The store is busy – it will be an exciting trading season.” Still, it is a tough time to be in the business of department stores. Family-owned group Fenwicks last week announced plans to close its Bond Street store after 130 years, and neighbours Debenhams and House of Fraser have both now quit their Oxford Street locations.

The demise of Sir Philip Green’s BHS empire in 2016 left holes in high streets across the UK. Debenhams, which once had more than 160 stores, is now online-only after falling into administration, while Beales, once a chain of more than 20 stores, is down to just three outlets after suffering the same fate.

House of Fraser has closed at least 25 stores since it was bought out of administration by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley’s retail group in 2018, and even John Lewis has closed 16 stores in the face of rising costs and the shift online. Hefty old buildings that were once the anchor point of many high streets are creaking at the seams as owners struggle with high property taxes, lower footfall and rising staff, maintenance and energy bills.

In Pitcher’s 11 years in charge at Selfridges group, which has two Manchester stores and one in Birmingham as well as the London flagship, sales have risen more than 40%. However, during the pandemic, the group made large losses: ?121.5m in the year to January 2022, and ?217m the year before, after a profit of ?34m pre-pandemic. The Weston family, owners of the group since 2003, sold Selfridges to the Thai conglomerate Central Group and Austrian property company Signa Holding in late 2021.

“For some, the future is dismal; for me the future is bright, and finding the way is the fun,” says Pitcher. She says that Selfridges’s secret sauce is that “we have risen above the brands we sell”.

“Constant change is fashion,” she adds, “and I’m not done yet.”

Pitcher has set up teams of “navigators” to explore the future across many aspects of Selfridges’s business, whether that is exploring the metaverse and trading in digital artworks or non-fungible tokens, improving the diversity of its workforce or finding more sustainable ways of trading.

“Where customers are playing, so we must too,” she says.

Pitcher’s start in retail came when she worked at an artists’ materials shop while still at school. Then after exams she secured a traineeship at Harrods – starting in the basement, answering queries about wine orders, as she tells it.

After 25 years, by which time she had risen to deputy merchandise director at the Knightsbridge department store, she left to become buying director at rival Harvey Nichols. A couple of years later, in 2004, she joined Selfridges as buying and merchandising director, before becoming boss of the department store in 2011, and in 2019 taking over as managing director of its parent group, which includes Irish department stores Brown Thomas and Arnotts, plus the De Bijenkorf chain in the Netherlands.

“I’ve done everything in the shop,” says Pitcher. She claims she didn’t set out to run a business but was “lucky in my choice – not everyone is lucky in their career choices”. But then she counters this with: “I don’t much believe in luck either.”

She was “always going to be bossy”, she admits, but also delivered what customers wanted by following her life rule – to “look, listen and learn”. She says she has “always embraced change”. So what about Oxford Street, one of the world’s premier shopping centres, which is now gap-toothed with closed and demolished stores?

Pitcher believes the street should be pedestrianised, and welcomes projects such as Marks & Spencer’s controversial Marble Arch redevelopment as the beginning of a new future. “At least something is happening,” she says. “The high street is a tragedy, but nothing is forever and we have to find something new. I don’t think it will ever recover to what it was – and nor should it. The current situation is down to how people changed and culture moved away from the city centre [during the pandemic].”

She says business has bounced back more firmly in Birmingham and Manchester than in London and that it will take a massive combined effort from business, local government and other bodies to bring people back to the capital’s premier shopping street.

The future must be about an “immunity loop of digital and physical” but must also be more climate-friendly.

“The planet has gone past the point of no return, and though many people don’t want to hear it, our customers and kids do,” she says.

After consulting employees, customers and even former staff, Pitcher came up with a bold plan to use Selfridges as a platform to flag environmental concerns and experiment with more sustainable models. But can a luxury store that makes it money from flogging new baubles to the largely well-off really make a difference?

Pitcher says it can be a leader, and help inspire change elsewhere. Her bold plans include aiming for almost half its interactions with customers to be based on resale, repair, rental or refills by 2030.

She admits that although “nobody makes any money” from such business practices at the moment, she will “because I think you can”. “We have to if we are going to consume less, and one way to do that is to find more value in the original purchase and all the things we enjoy.

“I would like fashion to slow down: I think it is too fast. Creatives can’t cope with the number of collections they have to design. Maybe we buy less and, per garment, spend more,” she says. “I don’t know, but we will make better choices.”

But now she is leaving, will Selfridges’s new owners stick to Pitcher’s grand green visions? She thinks so: “Well they just paid ?4bn for it, apparently, so they probably think it’s got a lot going for it. I think they are proud of what they bought, and inspired by what they see.

“We have been remaking retail here,” she says proudly. “And I am now going to do a remake of my own.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/13/selfridges-boss-anne-pitcher-i-would-like-fashion-to-slow-down
1;Peru’s Castillo calls new president a ‘usurper’ as protest death toll reaches seven;"Ousted Peruvian president Pedro Castillo has derided his successor as a “usurper”, and vowed to continue as head of state as the death toll from growing protests against the new government of Dina Boluarte rose to seven.

Demonstrations in support of Castillo spread from city to city on the sixth day of unrest, with widespread vandalism and looting showing little sign of abating.

All the victims died in clashes with police as a result of gunshot wounds, six of them in the southern city of Andahuaylas, which became a hub for the protests. Five of those victims were aged 18 or under, according to Peru’s human rights ombudsman and the local hospital. Reports of children mourning their dead schoolmates emerged on social media.

Another death was reported in Peru’s second-largest city Arequipa, where demonstrators took control of the airport’s runway and vandalised the control tower. Airlines have cancelled flights to Arequipa and Cusco, Peru’s tourism capital, amid the unrest.

The head of the Peru ombudsman’s office, Eliana Revollar, said a total of seven people had died during two days of protests, all from gunshot wounds.

At least 15 police officers were injured, also in Andahuaylas, by an explosive device, according to the police, and local news reports showed images of several seriously injured officers being treated on a patio in the city’s overflowing hospital.

Dozens of roads have been blocked in 11 regions across a swathe of southern Peru, as well as large parts of the east and north of the country, according to the police.

Furious protesters in the capital Lima overturned vehicles and smashed windows of the offices of three media organisations that house four private television channels seen as hostile to Castillo during his 17 months in office.

In a handwritten letter from prison, Castillo derided his successor and vowed to continue as head of state and to not abandon his “high and sacred functions”.

In the letter posted on Castillo’s Twitter account on Monday, the former leader addressed the “great and patient Peruvian people”, saying he had been “humiliated, [kept] incommunicado, mistreated and kidnapped” but added he was “still clothed with your trust and struggle”. He dismissed his successor as the “snot and slobber of the coup-mongering right”.

The missive came five days after Castillo was removed from office and detained on charges of rebellion, following his attempt to shutter congress and rule by decree in an effort to avoid his third impeachment.

It came shortly after Boluarte gave in to protesters’ demands for early general elections amid escalating unrest in the country.

In a televised address earlier on Monday, Boluarte said she would submit a bill to bring general elections forward by two years, to April 2024, following days of violent protests across the country. But her proposal is unlikely to stop surging protests as Castillo supporters call for Peru’s widely loathed congress to be closed and for early elections to be held. Amnesty International is calling on Peruvian authorities to avoid using excessive force in their response to the protests. “State repression against protesters is only deepening the crisis in Peru,” said the group’s Americas director Erika Guevara-Rosas.

Boluarte announced a state of emergency in the zones of “high social conflict” in the southern regions of Apur?mac, Arequipa and Ica, where protesters angry at what they see as a coup by congress have blocked roads and closed two airports.

Protests were widespread in rural strongholds of support for Castillo, a former schoolteacher and political novice from a poor Andean region. On Sunday, congress stripped Castillo of presidential immunity as he faces charges of “breaching the constitution”.

The demonstrators accuse Boluarte – Castillo’s former vice-president who was sworn in just hours after he was ousted – of betraying the former leader and usurping the presidency. Protesters in the capital, Lima, joined thousands across the country in clashing with riot police, who used teargas and baton charges to push them back.

“We don’t agree with the way our president was ousted, with lies and trickery,” said Laura Pacheco, a Castillo supporter protesting in San Mart?n square in downtown Lima.

“[Boluarte] doesn’t deserve to be president, she hasn’t been elected by the people. We are defending our democratic rights, we don’t want to be governed by a usurper,” she added.

Luc?a, who did not want to give her last name, was among hundreds of horn-blaring, flag-waving protesters calling for Boluarte and the deeply unpopular congress to go. “We want the congress to be shut down, we want new elections for Peru, where the people can choose who governs them,” she said.

“Castillo tried to shut down congress because that’s what the people wanted. It’s a viper’s nest!” she added, highlighting the widely held view that the unicameral congress is a venal hub of vested interests and corruption.

While virtually all the protesters called for the shutdown of congress, some held placards calling Castillo a “national hero” – not because of his governance but because he attempted to close the hated chamber, which has been consistently more despised than a long roster of unpopular former Peruvian presidents.

Eighty-six per cent of Peruvians disapprove of congress, more than the 61% disapproval rating for Castillo, according to a November opinion poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies. The same poll indicated that the vast majority of Peruvians, 87%, would prefer fresh general elections and a renewed congress in the event that Castillo was ousted.

“The crisis has not abated,” said Fernando Tuesta, a political science professor at Lima’s Pontifical Catholic University and former head of Peru’s electoral authority.

“Despite the proposal to bring forward the elections, the government of Dina Boluarte, already weak, has to deal with an unreliable congress, a cabinet with holes in it, and, above all, it has to know how to placate the demonstrations, which are growing angrily,” he said.

“If it’s not handled well, [Boluarte] may become the centre for the attacks,” he added.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/peru-pedro-castillo-new-president-dina-boluarte-usurper-early-election
1;How Cambodian women are using theatre to speak out against domestic abuse;"Chenda usually spends her days in her rural village collecting scrap metal and looking after her seven children. But on a recent afternoon, the 42-year-old woman wore a drawn-on moustache and checked men’s shirt as she staggered around a makeshift stage by a busy road, playing a drunk husband shouting at his wife.

“I’ve told you again and again. Don’t follow me and ask me to come back home when I’m drinking,” shouted the actor. “I will kill you.”

It was a scene that mirrored Chenda’s own experience of years of physical and emotional abuse from her husband. For the next 30 minutes, around 60 neighbours and friends sat watching under a big tent in the north-western city of Battambang, while Chenda and a small group of domestic violence survivors performed a story familiar to many in Cambodia – complete with a violent partner, gossiping neighbours and unresponsive authorities.

The show is part of a grassroots effort – led by local Khmer artists who have experienced or witnessed abuse themselves – to spark community discussions about domestic violence. Family violence remains a taboo topic, even as one in five Cambodian women report experiencing abuse from an intimate partner. “Before, when I had violence in my family, I never revealed it,” says Chenda. “[Now] I want to reveal it and tell everyone that it’s a problem.”

Nov Sreyleap, who co-founded the non-profit Lakhon Komnit, which produced the show, says her own family’s violent history made her shut down emotionally until she grew up and started performing as an actor. She wants the women to use theatre to “think for themselves” and open up to one another. “They can see their own story and start to understand their own life more and more,” she says.

Although Chenda’s show was timed to coincide with 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, Lakhon Komnit – which translates to “thinking theatre” – works with domestic abuse victims throughout the year, plus LGBTQ+ communities and people with disabilities, recruiting people to attend workshops, take part in role play and perform their own shows.

Cambodia’s theatre scene, along with other arts, was destroyed by the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s. Since then, theatre has been largely limited to traditional forms, such as shadow puppetry and apsara dancing, with theatre therapy like Lakhon Komnit’s almost unheard of throughout the country.

Trying theatre was deeply uncomfortable for Sreymean, a mother of three who works as a shop clerk. She wipes away tears as she recalls years of alcohol-fuelled abuse from her husband. At first, she didn’t like moving her body or speaking about herself, she says. Less than a year later, she has separated from her husband and felt comfortable inviting her adolescent children to the performance, even sharing the Facebook trailer with them beforehand. “They said, ‘Mum, this is you?’ And I asked, ‘Does it seem good?’ They said, ‘Yes, it’s really good’.”

“I don’t want my life to be like (it was before),” adds Sreymean. “I want my life to change.”

I have enough power to open my mouth and stand up to say whatever I want and do whatever I want
Chenda
When the show ended, the audience applauded before the actors started the scenes again. But this time, the audience raised their hands – calling “stop, stop!” – when they wanted a character to behave differently. One by one, an elderly woman, a teenager and a police officer stood up from their plastic chairs to take the place of different actors, improvising the scenes in a new way.

The elderly woman, acting as the neighbour, turned the character from a nosy bystander into an intervening hero. The police officer, playing the abused wife, avoided a confrontation by asking a friend to call the authorities. At one point, the facilitator asked for a show of hands: “If you were the family’s neighbour, would you be brave enough to stop the husband in the middle of an argument and call the authorities to intervene?”

Just a few people raised their hands. One of them, a 27-year-old woman who watched the show quietly from the back, explained afterwards that she has dealt with physical violence from her brother for her whole life. Watching the show and hearing people openly speak of abuse “really affects my feelings”, she says. But “the story is just acting. The important thing is the reality – can we behave as the actors are performing on stage or not?”

The performers are grappling with the same question. Chenda, who played the abusive husband, is living in a shelter while her real-life husband is in a drug detention centre. She is not sure when he will come home. Taking the lead role in the performance has made her “feel that I gained confidence [myself] – not by someone giving it to me”.

0;New Zealand passes world-first tobacco law to ban smoking for next generation;"New Zealand has introduced a steadily rising smoking age to stop those aged 14 and under from ever being able to legally buy cigarettes in world-first legislation to outlaw smoking for the next generation.

Associate health minister Ayesha Verrall said at the law’s passing on Tuesday: “Thousands of people will live longer, healthier lives and the health system will be $5bn better off from not needing to treat the illnesses caused by smoking, such as numerous types of cancer, heart attacks, strokes, amputations.” New Zealand is believed to be the first country in the world to implement the annually rising smoking age, ensuring tobacco cannot be sold to anyone born on or after 1 January 2009.

It will be accompanied by a slew of other measures to make smoking less affordable and accessible, including dramatically reducing the legal amount of nicotine in tobacco products and forcing them to be sold only through specialty tobacco stores, rather than corner stores and supermarkets.

The country has also increased funding for health services and campaigns, and rolled out quitting services specifically for M?ori and Pacific communities.

The number of stores legally allowed to sell cigarettes will be reduced to a tenth of their existing levels – from 6,000 to just 600 nationwide. The laws passed their final reading on Tuesday evening, and will come into force in 2023, as New Zealand attempts to reach its goal of making the country “smoke-free” by 2025.

While introducing the law for its first reading in July, Verrall said: “For decades we have permitted tobacco companies to maintain their market share by making their deadly product more and more addictive. It is disgusting and it is bizarre. We have more regulations in this country on the safety of the sale of a sandwich than on a cigarette. “We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth. People aged 14 when the law comes into effect will never be able to legally purchase tobacco.”

“Smoking rates are plummeting,” she added. “Our goal of being smoke-free by 2025 is within reach.”

The new laws, however, will not restrict vape sales. Data indicates that at least some New Zealanders haveswapped their nicotine habit from cigarettes to vapes.

Data released in November showed the number of people smoking daily had fallen to 8% – down from 9.4% last year – marking the lowest rates since records began.

The rise in daily vape users, however, was larger than the drop in daily smokers: 8.3% of adults are now vaping daily, up from 6.2% in the past year.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/13/new-zealand-passes-world-first-tobacco-law-to-ban-smoking-by-2025

0;UPDATE 2-UK's MJ Hudson suspends finance chief after audit woes grow;"Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's MJ Hudson Group on Monday suspended chief financial officer Peter Connell and warned it would not be able to complete its full-year audit by the end of December as more discrepancies in its financials came to light.

Connell had stepped down as director in October, days after the firm, which provides advisory, outsourcing and data services to asset managers, said it was unlikely to meet its profit forecast after making audit adjustments related to a major contract.

The 61-year-old Briton has been with MJ Hudson since its inception in 2010 and was scheduled to remain as the firm's CFO until it finalised and published its results for the 12 months ended June 30, 2022. He is no longer performing the function of a CFO, a representative for MJ Hudson confirmed in an e-mail to Reuters. Connell's position was to be taken over by someone new after the completion of the audit, though the company has not given a time frame.

MJ Hudson said on Monday it was aware that additional issues were uncovered in the ongoing audit, including those related to reporting historical trading for fiscal 2022, which would delay the auditing process.

It added that the full impact of these discoveries was unclear, and said its shares were also suspended from trading.

Connell did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent through networking platform LinkedIn.

""The Board has appointed an external accounting and financial services firm to assist them in achieving the necessary clarity to enable the year-end FY 2022 reporting to be completed,"" MJ Hudson said in a statement.

It declined to comment further on the audit issue and said it would provide updates on its ongoing search for a new CFO ""as soon as the company is in a position to do so"".

The National Grid will run a planned test which will see snow-hit households paid to cut their energy use between 5pm and 7pm, when record prices are expected during the peak demand hours on Monday. 

Thousands are facing rush-hour hell tonight as heavy snowfall turned into ice, and fog warnings are in place, making for treacherous conditions for those trying to get home after 9cm of snow fell in parts of England today. Flights were axed, sections of motorway closed for several hours and trains halted due to the adverse weather, causing a knock-on effect of significant disruption for those making journeys later in the day. The UK faces its biggest test yet with the current cold snap - which has seen the country suffer freezing temperatures and snow in many areas - ramping up demand for power at a time when supplies are tight.
UK next day electricity prices surged yesterday to help attract power imports through interconnectors from Europe and record prices are expected during the peak demand hours between 5pm and 7pm on Monday.

0;Malkin's late goal lifts Penguins past Stars 2-1;"PITTSBURGH (AP) - The playoffs are still months away for Pittsburgh and Dallas. Yet they provided a glimpse of what likely awaits each of them in the spring, a time of year when space gets tight and open ice essentially vanishes.

For two of the NHL's highest-scoring teams, playing responsibly on the defensive end in December can be a challenge. But the Penguins played with grit and goaltending in a 2-1 victory over the Stars on Monday night that pushed their win streak to six.

Evgeni Malkin's flip into an essentially open net with 34 seconds remaining provided the difference. The Russian star pounced on a loose puck just in front of the Dallas crease and fired it by sprawled goaltender Jake Oettinger for the 79th game-winning goal of his career. ""I know I have couple chances (earlier in the game),"" Malkin said. ""I almost have breakaway. I know it?s coming. (I just had to be patient) and use my chance.""

Yet what caught Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan's eye about Malkin wasn't the goal but a backcheck Malkin made earlier in the period, which showed a solid defensive effort by a team that can sometimes turn games into a track meet where chances are traded freely.

Facing the equally high-powered Stars, Pittsburgh stayed patient while improving to 13-2-2 over its last 17 games. ""It, without a doubt, had a playoff feel in the sense that you had to fight for every inch,"" Sullivan said.

Malkin's ninth goal of the year came after Bryan Rust's shot attempt from in close was poke-checked away. When Rust's momentum carried him into Oettinger, Malkin had all the space he needed to make sure the game didn't go to overtime.

""I thought we played a great road game,"" Oettinger said. ""We gave ourselves every chance to win - just a bad bounce at the end. So I think we have to be proud of how we played. We feel like we deserved a point or two. That stings, but we have to flush it quick.""

Pierre-Olivier Joseph scored his first goal of the season for Pittsburgh. Tristan Jarry stopped 26 shots to improve to 9-0-2 in his last 11 starts.

Roope Hintz collected his 12th goal of the season for Dallas. Oettinger made 23 saves but had no chance on Malkin's winner after Rust essentially spun Oettinger around after the two collided at the top of the crease. The goal was reviewed for goaltender interference but ultimately stood.

A showdown between rising Dallas star Jason Robertson - who came in as the NHL's second-leading goal scorer behind Edmonton's Connor McDavid - and Penguins captain Sidney Crosby offered the promise of a shootout.

Robertson was held without a shot for the second time this season, and Crosby mustered only two in 19 minutes of ice time. Two of the league's highest-scoring teams played the type of game that's the norm the late spring, not a couple of weeks before Christmas.

""It seemed like both teams defended really hard,"" Sullivan said. ""We were trying to make it as hard on them as they were trying to make it on us. So it was one of those games.""

Hintz needed just 19 seconds to give the Stars the lead, swooping behind the Pittsburgh net to the right circle and finding himself in the right spot when a long shot from the point by Nils Lundkvist deflected off Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang right to Hintz's stick.

Jarry quickly settled down and Joseph evened the score with a pretty wrist shot the left circle that found its way around a perfect screen by teammate Jason Zucker and into the net 13:14 into the first for Joseph's second career goal and first since Feb. 6, 2021.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11531595/Malkins-late-goal-lifts-Penguins-past-Stars-2-1.html
1;EU reaches deal on Ukraine aid, tax on big corporations;"BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union reached a deal in principle to send an 18 billion euro ($18.93 billion) financial aid package to Ukraine and approve a minimum tax on major corporations in a big move that narrowed a rift between the bloc and recalcitrant member Hungary.

The 27 envoys of the EU nations reached a tentative agreement late Monday in a deal that also sees Budapest getting a bigger part of promised funds that had long been in jeopardy over complaints by the other member states that Prime Minister Viktor Orban had veered away from the democratic rule of law.

""Megadeal!,"" the EU?s Czech presidency said on Twitter. The deal is still tentative because it needs to be signed off on but no major obstacles are expected. Hungary had used its veto up to now to get the two major deals through, amid complaints from others that Orban was abusing his powers so he could get his recovery and aid funds.

The deal comes ahead of Thursday's summit of EU leaders and a continued rift with Budapest could have turned the meeting into a major standoff.

Under the agreement in principle, Hungary sees a pandemic recovery plan approved worth 5.8 billion euros if Budapest implement 27 ""super milestones"" on democratic reforms to unlock the funding. Many nations had already said Hungary had made some positive efforts. And the nations also agreed to decrease the proposed suspension in regular aid funds by about 1.2 billion euros to some approximately 6.3 billion euros in commitments.

The deal allows Orban to claim victory because he was able reduce the penalties he faced. But he still was slapped with major fines that are likely to impact his struggling economy.

""A small but important victory"" for the rule of law in the EU, said Petri Sarvamaa, the parliament's negotiator on the issue.

The EU as a whole will be able to present a united front backing Ukraine after unseemly scenes of political brinkmanship had delayed the process for long and left a needy ally in the lurch and facing a major struggle to make financial commitments next year.

Equally, the EU had been unable to live up to a commitment to stop the race to the bottom in corporate tax rates. With Monday's measure, the profit of companies with annual turnover beyond 750 million euros will be taxed at 15% or more.

The EU institutions have been in a standoff with Orban for years. They decided to go after Orban for what he calls his brand of ""illiberal democracy"" but which is seen by others as unfit for the EU?s traditional sense of Western democratic liberalism.

Many divisive issues with Orban remain though, not least his relationship with Russia which is seen as lenient to Moscow compared to those of his 26 partners. ";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-11530913/EU-reaches-deal-Ukraine-aid-tax-big-corporations.html

1;EU targets Iran over protest crackdown, Russia drone sales;"BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union foreign ministers imposed new sanctions Monday on Iranian clerics, senior officials and top state media employees over the brutal crackdown on protesters, and also on experts they believe are linked to supplying Russia with explosive drones to use in its war against Ukraine.

The ministers imposed bans on traveling to Europe and froze the assets of 20 individuals. They also froze the assets of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, saying the media outlet was a ""mouthpiece"" for ""the violent response to the recent demonstrations in Iran.""

Iranian women - and some men - have protested the government?s severe restrictions on their daily life since late September after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic?s strict dress code. Iran executed a second prisoner convicted over crimes committed during the nationwide protests challenging the country?s theocracy, publicly hanging him Monday from a construction crane as a gruesome warning to others.

In a statement, the EU ministers called on Iran ""to immediately end the strongly condemnable practice of imposing and carrying out death sentences against protesters as well as to annul without delay the recent death penalty sentences that were already pronounced.""

The ministers also hit out at Iran for supplying drones to Russia, saying the ""weapons provided by Iran are being used indiscriminately by Russia against Ukrainian civilian population and infrastructure causing horrendous destruction and human suffering."" Four people and four ""entities"" - often agencies, media outlets, companies or organizations - were hit with sanctions ""for undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.""

Ukraine?s Western-reinforced air defenses have made it difficult for Russian warplanes to operate, and explosive drones are a cheap weapon that can seek out and destroy targets while spreading fear among both troops and civilians.

Russia stands accused of sending waves of Iranian-made drones over Ukraine to strike at power plants and other key infrastructure. The EU has said it had evidence that Iran sold drones to Russia since the war's beginning in February.

The foreign ministers warned Tehran against supplying more weapons and ""in particular any steps toward possible transfers of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, which would constitute a serious escalation.""

They said the EU would respond to any act that supports Russian aggression against Ukraine ""and hold Iran accountable, including through additional restrictive measures.""

Last month, the EU imposed sanctions on the chief of Iran?s Revolutionary Guard, the guard corp?s Aerospace Force and a company making drones that the bloc alleged Russia has used in Ukraine.

1;Police raid more EU Parliament offices in corruption probe;"BRUSSELS (AP) - Belgian police conducted more raids at European Parliament offices Monday as the legislature's president pledged to launch an internal investigation into corruption allegations and the bloc's top official called for the creation of an EU-wide independent ethics body.

Prosecutors investigating alleged influence peddling by a Gulf country at the European Parliament charged four people over the weekend with corruption, participation in a criminal group and money laundering. Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili of Greece was relieved of her duties.

The prosecutors declined to identify the country suspected of offering cash or gifts to parliament officials in exchange for political favors. Several members of the assembly and some Belgian media linked the investigation to Qatar, which is currently hosting soccer?s gala event, the World Cup. Qatar?s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied any wrongdoing.

Police conducted Monday?s raids at European Parliament offices in Brussels to seize computer data belonging to 10 parliamentary assistants, prosecutors said. Officers have conducted 20 raids in total as part of an investigation launched four months ago.

""Several hundred thousand euros have been seized in three different places: 600,000 euros at the home of one of the suspects, several hundred thousand euros in a suitcase seized in a room of a Brussels hotel, and about 150,000 euros in an apartment belonging to an MEP,"" prosecutors said. Kaili, who was relieved of her duties over the weekend, was expelled Monday from the legislature's Socialists and Democrats group with immediate effect.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU?s executive arm, said the accusations against Kaili threatened the confidence EU citizens have put in the 27-nation bloc?s institutions.

She said the independent ethics body she proposed establishing would cover lobbying activities at the European Commission, the European Council and European Parliament, as well as at the European Central Bank, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors.

The EU does not already have comprehensive lobbying regulations.

""The principles of having such an ethics body where there are very clear rules on what has to be checked, how and when and what has to be published, how and when would be a big step forward,"" she said.

As the European Parliament began its last plenary session of the year in Strasbourg, France, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola promised ""there will be no sweeping under the carpet.""

She said the Parliament and European democracies were ""under attack"" by ""malign actors, linked to autocratic third countries.""

""We will launch a reform process to see who has access to our premises, how these organizations, NGOs and people are funded, what links with third countries they have,"" Metsola added. ""We will ask for more transparency on meetings with foreign actors and those linked to them. We will shake up this Parliament and this town, and I need your help to do it.""

On Friday, police in Belgium?s capital carried out multiple raids as part of the investigation and reported seizing cash, computer equipment and mobile telephones.

The federal prosecutor's office, without identifying any individual, said four of six people detained that day were subsequently charged, and two were released.

Raids also took place in Italy on Sunday.

Prosecutors have confirmed that a parliament member was arrested but declined to confirm it was Kaili, 44, a former TV news anchor. They said they suspect ""the payment of large sums of money, or the offer of significant gifts"" to people holding with influential positions at the European Parliament.

Metsola relieved Kaili of her duties over the weekend. Kaili's party in Greece also suspended her and publicly distanced itself from remarks she made in the EU parliament last month praising Qatar,

Qatar came under heavy international pressure to introduce labor reforms in recent years as it sought to build new World Cup stadiums in record time, often using migrant workers who toiled for long hours under harsh conditions.

The EU and Qatar have strengthened their economic relationships since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine. Moscow slashed supplies of natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry in Europe in response to EU sanctions, worsening an energy crisis that is fueling inflation.

The EU has looked for alternatives to buy liquefied natural gas on a long-term basis, notably in Qatar.

In April, the European Commission proposed lifting visa requirements for short EU stays by Qatari nationals. Metsola said negotiations with the Parliament on the proposal would be postponed.

""I was scheduled today to announce the opening of the negotiating mandate for the visa waiver report with Qatar and Kuwait,"" she said. ""In light of the investigations, this report must be sent back to committee.""

Asked whether Belgian authorities were in touch with the European Commission as part of their investigation, von der Leyen said she had no clue. She added that rhe commission was reviewing its own political transparency register.

""If any kind of new information occurs, we will have to act and react to that,"" she said.

Several Socialists and Democrats lawmakers fell on their swords after the group said that any member being investigated should be suspended, or should give up certain of their duties if any of their staff members were under investigation.

Belgian EU lawmaker Marc Tarabella suspended himself outright. His compatriot, Maria Arena, stepped down as chair of the assembly?s Human Rights Committee

""Following the revelations of suspicion of corruption linked to Qatar and the European Parliament, and the search of one of my assistants in the framework of this affair, I have decided that temporarily I will no longer preside over meetings of the Human Rights Committee,"" Arena tweeted.

Italian S&D lawmaker Pietro Bartolo also temporarily stepped down as shadow rapporteur for the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee. Another Italian member of the European Parliament, Andrea Cozzolino, stopped performing certain tasks temporarily.

Ghent University Professor Hendrik Vos, an EU expert, told The Associated Press the case could have lingering repercussions on the generally positive image of the European Parliament.

""There has never been such a massive corruption scandal hitting the Parliament,"" he said. ""It is so profound because it jars so fundamentally with what Parliament pretends to stand for. The Parliament pretends to stand for transparency, unable to be bribed, to defend fundamental values. And then, you get something like this.""

Following is a list of recent attacks on foreigners in Afghanistan:  December, 2022 * At least three attackers were killed by security forces in Afghanistan on Monday after armed men opened fire inside a hotel in central Kabul popular with Chinese nationals.

* Cross-border shelling and gunfire between Afghanistan and Pakistan killed six Pakistani civilians and one Afghan soldier, officials on both sides of the frontier said, with each side accusing the other of starting the fighting.

* Pakistan's embassy in Kabul came under attack with gunfire wounding a Pakistani security guard, officials said, in what Islamabad called an attempt to assassinate its head of mission, who was unhurt.

September, 2022

* Two Russian embassy staff were killed in a suicide bombing near the country's diplomatic mission in the Afghan capital, Kabul, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

August, 2021

Household wealth dropped another $400 billion in the third quarter, to $143 trillion, marking the third straight quarterly decline according to a Fed report on Friday.

Over the first three quarters of the year, the stock market lost more than $2 trillion in value, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 21 percent and the S&P 500 losing more than 25 percent of its value. Wall Street's three straight quarterly declines marked the longest losing streak for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq since 2008, and the Dow's longest quarterly slump in seven years. 

The resulting dent in investment and retirement accounts took a steep bite out of family wealth, which had soared to new highs last year thanks to government stimulus programs, higher savings rates and a roaring stock market. Tech stocks were among the hardest hit this year, as their high-flying valuations corrected sharply in the bear market. 

The stock market's dismal recent performance follows soaring inflation, rapidly rising interest rates, and fears that the economy could soon crash into a sharp downturn with massive layoffs and soaring unemployment.

1;Boris Johnson calls for the UK to supply Ukraine with longer-range weapons to take out 'merciless' Russian drones and missiles targeting civilian power network;"Boris Johnson today called for the UK to supply Ukraine with longer-range weapons to target Russian drones and missiles.

The former PM told the Commons it was not enough to tackle such strikes when they were in the air, and Kiev's forces needed the capability to hit launch sites further away.

Sources close to Mr Johnson told MailOnline that he was referring to targets in Ukraine, rather than in Russia.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Vladimir Putin of breaking 'all the rules of law and taking advantage of Ukraine's short-range weapons to launch 'Iranian kamikaze drones'.

Moscow has provoked worldwide fury with attacks on civilian infrastructure such as the power network, leaving millions of people struggling for heat and light.   Mr Wallace said he was 'open-minded' about what to do next if Russia continues to hammer civilian areas. 

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Johnson said broadening the weapons given to Ukraine could help 'bring the war to an end'.

'The House will know that supplies of British, American and other Western equipment have been absolutely vital in helping our Ukrainian friends to protect themselves against continuing and merciless Russian attacks, and I thank him and the Government for all that they have done and continue to do,' he told Mr Wallace.

'Does he agree with me that we and our allies must help our Ukrainian friends not just to take out the drones and missiles, and that means supplying them with anti-aircraft systems and fixed-wing aircraft to help shoot them down, but also to take out the launch sites of those missiles and drones by supplying the Ukrainians with the use of longer-range missile systems such as ATACMS because that is the way truly to protect our Ukrainian friends and to bring the war to an end as soon as possible?'

Mr Wallace replied: 'He's absolutely right that the Russians are taking advantage of the short-range capability of the Ukrainian armed forces by using these Iranian kamikaze drones.

'As we see against all the rules of law, including the Geneva Conventions, the mass targeting of civilian critical infrastructure is not only a war crime, but is a war crime that we must see does not go unpunished.'

Mr Wallace said he constantly reviews the 'weapon systems we could provide', adding: 'Should the Russians continue to target civilian areas and try and break those Geneva Conventions, then I will be open-minded to seeing what we do next.'

1;Vladimir Putin can't be trusted in peace talks over Ukraine and could use them to buy time, James Cleverly warns;"Vladimir Putin could use peace talks with Ukraine to buy time to rearm and cannot be trusted to enter negotiations in good faith, the Foreign Secretary warned yesterday.

James Cleverly said that while Britain wanted to see talks ‘sooner rather than later’, any negotiations ‘need to be real... they can’t just be a fig leaf for Russian rearmament and further recruitment of soldiers’.

He told Sky News: ‘I’m not seeing anything coming from the Russian side that gives me confidence Vladimir Putin is entering these talks in good faith.’ The Russian president said on Friday a peace deal was likely to be needed to end the war. Ukrainian forces struck the HQ of the notorious Wagner mercenary group in Luhansk, the region’s Ukrainian governor claimed last night. Serhiy Haidai said a hotel in Kadiivka was hit, with major Russian losses.

There are claims the attack on Russian barracks in occupied Melitopol left 200 troops killed or wounded.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 1.5million people were left without power after Russia used Iranian drones to strike Odesa. ";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11527401/Vladimir-Putin-trusted-peace-talks-Ukraine-use-buy-time.html
0;Shocking moment woke Pennsylvania school board treasurer says she cannot vote for 'the only cis white male' candidate for president - despite admitting he'd do an 'excellent' job;"A school treasurer in Pennsylvania has refused to vote for the 'only cis white male' on the board to become their next president - despite admitting she believed he would do an 'excellent' job.

The Upper Moreland School District, in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia, held its board president election on December 6.

Treasurer Jennifer Solot, who led the meeting until a new president was elected, said it would 'send the wrong message' to elect Greg D'Elia over April Stainback. 'I believe that Mr. D’Elia would make an excellent president. However, I feel that electing the only cis white male on this board president of this district sends the wrong message to our community: a message that is contrary to what we as a board have been trying to accomplish' she said. 'Mrs. Stainback has done an exemplary job as president these last few months, and the strength of her performance has earned her my vote tonight,' she added. 

Ms. Stainback defeated Mr D'Elia - a father-of-three who previously served as an area School Director and during previous races had the backing of area Democrats - 8-1.

Online reactions to Solot's commentary were none-too-kind, accusing the mother and school board member of 'racism' and asking whether there is 'a petition for Jennifer Solot to resign.'

Self-styled local political commentator Joe Rittenhouse wrote on Facebook that Solot's statement 'reflects poorly on the district and the values of public education.'

He branded her comments a 'sexist, racist tirade on camera attacking people on their fitness to be elected school board president based on skin color, sexual orientation, and gender.'

'Shame on Jennifer Solot. Resign,' he wrote.  Ms. Solot's comments were followed by new board member Sarah Byrnes, who paused before saying, 'This is very hard to do as the new person on the board,' before casting her vote for Ms. Stainback.

Rose Huber also hesitated before ultimately voting for Stainback, a mother of five who has also served as a school director in the area. D'Elia, an active community member, has lived in the Upper Moreland area for about 15 years and is father to three children, two of whom attend Upper Moreland schools.

He said his interest in the school board was amplified after one of his children began struggling in class with school 'and was having a very bad experience.'

His experience getting his child special education resources inspired him to run for office to 'improve access to special services for students.'

During his 2019 campaign for school director, his platform revolved around 'the importance of education' and the belief that it is 'the responsibility for the entire community to educate the next generation.'

As a trained Mechanical Engineer, D'Elia pledged to introduce his professional prospective to 'gather data to make decisions and most effectively use resources.'";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11529085/Pennsylvania-school-board-treasurer-vote-cis-white-male-candidate-president.html
0;Ministers will hold emergency Cobra meeting today to discuss Christmas strike chaos – with plan to deploy the army and civil servants to combat Border Force and hospital walkouts;"Plans for military staff and civil servants to cover for striking workers in the coming weeks will be discussed by ministers at a Cobra emergency meeting today.

The Army is being sent in because the country is set to be hit by a wave of strikes over the coming weeks as Royal Mail staff, nurses, paramedics, rail employees and Border Force officials all stage walkouts over jobs, pay and conditions.

Military personnel and civil servants are being trained in case they are required to be drafted in at ports and airports, as border staff prepare to strike for eight days from December 23 to New Year's Eve. As southern England was crippled by snow overnight, hundreds of troops will be deployed to hospitals this week to help maintain vital services during a fortnight of reckless strikes in the run-up to Christmas. Military personnel will begin emergency training at hospital trusts across the country to allow them to drive ambulances during a planned walkout by paramedics next week.

Ministers will today convene the Government’s emergency Cobra committee to finalise contingency plans for dealing with a planned strike by nurses on Thursday, and fresh walkouts by rail staff and postal workers aimed at crippling the country as Christmas approaches.

Troops are already being trained to step in for Border Force airport guards, who are threatening days of disruption timed to wreck families’ plans to get away for the festive period.

Highways staff are also planning to walk out in a series of rolling strikes designed to cause disruption on the roads.

And the British Medical Association (BMA) yesterday warned that a strike by junior doctors in pursuit of a 26 per cent pay demand was ‘very likely’.

As Britain tonight faced its worst winter of industrial strife for decades:

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly indicated that ministers could ban emergency service workers, including paramedics and firefighters, from taking strike action;
NHS medical director Sir Stephen Powis warned the strikes were happening at the worst possible time, with the health service facing an early flu outbreak and a new Covid wave;
Labour health spokesman Wes Streeting admitted that no government could meet the RCN’s extraordinary pay demands;
Government sources said Rishi Sunak was convinced that yielding to union pay demands would ‘embed’ inflation for years, crippling living standards;
Ministers stepped up talks with rail chiefs amid fears the strikes could affect ‘critical’ freight deliveries in areas including energy;
Weather forecasters warned that commuters struggling to get to work during the rail strikes would face the worst weather of the winter, with freezing temperatures and snow predicted;
Labour MPs boasted they would join picket lines in support of unions which have given the party ?15 million since Sir Keir Starmer became leader;
Hospitality bosses said rail strikes could cost the sector ?1.5 billion as businesses cancel office parties because staff cannot get home.
Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden last night urged militant union leaders to call off the ‘damaging’ strikes.

He said: ‘The stance the unions have taken will cause disruption for millions of hardworking people over the coming weeks.’

Mr Dowden, who will lead Cobra meetings on strikes today and on Wednesday, said ministers were working to keep disruption ‘to a minimum’, but acknowledged that key services would suffer. He said that funding inflation-level pay rises for the entire public sector would cost the taxpayer ?28 billion, equal to almost ?1,000 per household. 

‘Of course we want to ensure that people are paid fairly, but what isn’t fair is for union bosses to put people’s livelihoods at risk in order to push their pay demands to the front of the queue,’ he said. ‘Nor would it be fair to ask families to pay an extra ?1,000 a year to meet the union demands.’

Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the strikes would create ‘significant risks’ to patients.

The Royal College of Nursing, which was seeking a 19 per cent pay rise, yesterday indicated that it knows its demands are unreasonable, with sources saying the union would settle for increases at or even below inflation.

Mr Barclay said it was inevitable that patients would suffer. He told The Sun: ‘In a winter when we’re worrying about Covid, flu and Strep A – on top of the Covid backlogs – I am deeply concerned about the risks of strike action to patients.’

Sir Stephen said there was ‘trouble brewing this winter’ for the NHS, but patients needing urgent care would still get seen.

Emma Runswick, deputy chairman of the BMA Council, said junior doctors had suffered a real-terms pay cut of 26 per cent since 2008. Challenged over the scale of the extraordinary pay demand, she told Sky News: ‘It’s only as steep as the money that has been cut from us.’

Mr Cleverly confirmed that the Prime Minister was working on measures to tighten strike laws, including potentially expanding the ban on police officers striking to other emergency services.

‘It is the first duty of the Government to make sure that people are protected,’ he told Times Radio.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11528055/Ministers-hold-emergency-Cobra-meeting-today-discuss-Christmas-strike-chaos.html
1;Collapsed crypto firm FTX splurged $5BN on investments that may now be worth 'only a fraction' of that in the year before bankruptcy, new CEO tells lawmakers in damning testimony - with billions in assets still missing;"FTX went on a $5 billion 'spending binge' in the year before it collapsed, buying up businesses and investments that are likely now worth 'only a fraction' of that amount, its new CEO has told lawmakers.

The failed company squandered the eye-watering amount 'in late 2021 through 2022' before it filed for bankruptcy, leaving about one million customers owed billions of dollars.

John J Ray III, the new CEO of FTX appointed to guide it through bankruptcy, made the disclosure in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. The committee will hear from Ray on Tuesday, as well as from disgraced FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces criminal charges over the company's demise.  Ray, who is leading a team of investigators who are trying to recoup investors' money, also repeated damning claims he's made previously about the calamitous lack of corporate controls at FTX.

He previously helped deal with the fallout from the Enron scandal, once the largest corporate bankruptcy in US history. 

 Despite tackling a disaster of that magnitude, he described the FTX collapse as unprecedented.

Ray also says that more than $1 billion of digital assets have been secured by the bankruptcy team. But that is far less than the $10 billion that some estimate is owed to clients.

He said in a statement to the committee on Monday: 'Never in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11530421/Collapsed-crypto-firm-FTX-splurged-5BN-investments-worth-fraction.html
1;Pentagon fires hypersonic missile that can travel at five times the speed of sound from a B-52 bomber in first operational test - as China and Russia up their arsenal;"The U.S. Air Force completed an 'operational' test of a prototype hypersonic missile that flew more than five times the speed of sound after being released from a hulking 5-52 bomber, the Pentagon said Monday.

The test, carried out off the California coast, is the latest test of the ultra-fast weaponry as the U.S. attempts to remain competitive with strategic rivals with the brutal war in Ukraine as the backdrop.

A previous test in May also achieved hypersonic speeds with the release of an Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) from a B-52.   'A B-52H Stratofortress successfully released the first All-Up-Round AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon off the Southern California coast, Dec. 9,' said the statement released Monday from Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhandle.

'This test was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile. Previous test events focused on proving the booster performance.' According to the Air Force, after the B-52 released the missile, 'it reached hypersonic speeds greater than five times the speed of sound, completed its flight path and detonated in the terminal area.'

'Indications show that all objectives were met,' according to the statement, which did not include accompanying photographs.

Brig. Gen. Jason Bartolomei, Armament Directorate Program Executive Officer, touted the speed of not just the missile, but the the program, which comes as the Russians claim already to have used their missile in combat.  

'The ARRW team successfully designed and tested an air-launched hypersonic missile in five years,' he said in the statement. 'I am immensely proud of the tenacity and dedication this team has shown to provide a vital capability to our warfighter.'

Russia has fired hypersonic missiles at targets in Ukraine and China has tested hypersonic weapons, U.S. military officials have said.

The last milestone came in May, when the Air Force announced it had successfully tested a hypersonic weapon, as it tries to catch up with rapid advances made by rivals around the world.

That also involved the release of an ARRW by a B-52 off the coast of Southern California. 

'Following separation from the aircraft, the ARRW's booster ignited and burned for expected duration, achieving hypersonic speeds five times greater than the speed of sound,' it said.

The United States is not alone in developing hypersonic weapons, whose speed and maneuverability make them difficult to track and intercept. China's foreign ministry denied in October that it had conducted a weapons test.

Lawmakers have repeatedly warned that the U.S. risks being left behind by its competitors. 

And progress was not helped by a string of failed tests.

The weapon was supposed to reach operational status by October, but problems last year - when the Lockheed-built missile failed three consecutive booster motor tests - pushed that deadline back. 

Air Force Program Executive Officer for Weapons Brig. Gen. Heath Collins said: 'The team's tenacity, expertise, and commitment were key in overcoming the past year's challenges to get us to the recent success.

'We are ready to build on what we've learned and continue moving hypersonics forward.'

Lockheed Martin said the latest test demonstrated the weapon's ability to withstand operational hypersonic speeds and ensure safe separation from the aircraft. 'The need for hypersonic strike capabilities is critical to our nation and this successful test will help us to maintain an accelerated and rigorous timeline,' said Dave Berganini, vice president of Hypersonic and Strike Systems at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. 

'Our strong partnership with the U.S. Air Force has allowed us to quickly progress hypersonic technologies for our men and women in uniform.'

In a sign of the urgency facing Washington, the U.S. announced last month it was teaming up with the United Kingdom and Australia to accelerate development. 

'We also committed today to commence new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonics, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as to expand information sharing and to deepen cooperation on defense innovation,' said the three nations.

'These initiatives will add to our existing efforts to deepen cooperation on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities.' UNITED STATES

The US military has a number of hypersonic weapons programs across the Navy, Army and Air Force but most are still in development phase and highly top secret. 

However the known programs are all more conventional hypersonic weapons that strike from high altitude, rather than orbital bombardment systems that strike from space which the Chinese were revealed to have developed tis week. 

The only US hypersonic weapon know to have been successfully tested is the Air Force's GM-183 ARRW which is designed to be launched from a large bomber aircraft. 

It then accelerates to hypersonic speeds using of up to 15,345mph using a supersonic combustion ramjet to strike targets within 1,000 miles. Donald Trump referred to a 'super duper missile' while in office and this is believed to be the AGM-183 ARRW.

The Navy's submarine launched Long Range Hypersonic Weapon is expected to be operational by 2023 and will have a range of 1,725 miles.  

Darpa, the US army's scientific wing, recently announced successful tests of what it called a HAWC missile (Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept) but kept details such as range, speed and payload secret. 

The missile uses oxygen in the atmosphere as part of its fuel - marking the first successful test of that class of weapon since 2013.

The missile, which is built by Raytheon, was released from an aircraft just 'seconds' before the scramjet engine from Northrop Grumman kicked on, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said. 

The engine works by compressing incoming air with hydrocarbon fuel to create a fast airflow mixture, one capable of reaching over 1,700 meters per second, or five times the speed of sound. 

Earlier this year, a test of a hypersonic missile from the U.S. Air Force was abandoned after it was unable to complete its launch sequence.  

On March 19 last year, the Pentagon flight-tested a hypersonic glide vehicle at its Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii. It deemed the test a success and 'a major milestone towards the department's goal of fielding hypersonic warfighting capabilities in the early- to mid-2020s.'

Unlike Russia, the United States says it is not developing hypersonic weapons for use with a nuclear warhead. As a result, a U.S. hypersonic weapon will need to be more accurate, posing additional technical challenges.

In 2004, NASA's experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft X-43 reached 7,366mph (Mach 9.6) using a scramjet engine, setting the current record.

In 2019, DailyMail.com reported that the Raytheon and Northrop Grumman-developed missile would use an engine made by a 3D printer. 

Last year, DARPA said it was working with Aerojet Rocketdyne on a nearly $20 million project to develop a hypersonic rocket that could intercept enemy missiles mid-air. RUSSIA  

Russia recently launched a hypersonic missile, the Zircon, from a submarine, and since late 2019 has had the hypersonic nuclear-capable Avangard missiles in service. The Avangard can travel at up to Mach 27, changing course and altitude.  

The range of Russia's hypersonic missile, the Zircon, is 621 miles with a speed of 9,800mph.

But the missile flies below the atmosphere and uses fuel to power itself to hypersonic speeds rather than the Earth's orbit. 

Earlier this month, Russia  announced it has successfully test-fired the Zircon from a nuclear submarine for the first time. 

The 6,670mph weapon hit a target in the Barents Sea according to the Moscow defence ministry, who claims the missile is capable of Mach-9 speeds and able to evade all Western defences. 

Russia said it had completed flight tests of the new-age missile from a frigate - the Admiral Gorshkov - and a coastal mount, but it had not previously been launched from a submarine.

The Zircon has been identified by Moscow's state-controlled TV as Vladimir Putin's weapon of choice to wipe out coastal American cities in the event of an atomic conflict.

He has declared the missile as 'truly unparalleled anywhere in the world', and the Russians have boasted it is 'unstoppable' by Western defences.

Putin first announced the development of an array of new hypersonic weapons in 2018, insisting that they would be able to hit almost any point in the world and evade a US-built missile shield. 

The Zircon is due to go into service next year, and will first be deployed via the Admiral Golovko frigate which carries significant stealth-technology. 

A key use of the missile is taking out enemy ships and reports suggested its maximum range is between 188 and 620 miles.

But there have been unconfirmed reports its true range is some 1,200 miles.

The missile system's design and development have been conducted in deep secrecy, and Putin has warned that foreign spies have tried to steal its secrets.

It is one of a number of hypersonic missiles Russia is deploying including the 188-tonne Sarmat - known in the West as Satan-2 - which will be the biggest beast in Russia's nuclear arsenal, due for tests in the autumn with deployment slated for next year.

In May, Russia said it tested three 'invincible' hypersonic 'Satan 2' missiles that some have said could wipe out areas the size of England and Wales.  CHINA 

The hypersonic orbital bombardment system that China tested in August reportedly reaches a top speed of 21,000 mph and strikes from space.  

The core concept of China's 'new' weapon - deliver a warhead into orbit and have it circle the globe before hitting a target - was first developed by the Soviets in the 1960s. 

Called a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS, it was developed to evade powerful US radar arrays and missile defence systems.

Those systems work by detecting launches of ICBMs - very long-range missiles that can be tipped with nukes - and tracking them into space, then firing at the warheads as they come down in the hope of blowing them up before they hit their targets.

This is possible because ICBMs and their warheads follow a predictable trajectory that rises high into space - making them relatively easy to spot and allowing defence crews to calculate where they are aimed so they can be shot out of the sky. 

FOBS aim to negate these defences by firing their warheads along a much-flatter trajectory - assisted by Earth's gravity. 

This means they pass under the scope of many radar detection arrays and are harder to track. It also makes the warheads much harder to shoot down because their trajectory is harder to calculate.  

The use of orbit makes a warhead's range potentially unlimited, meaning it can be fired at its target from any direction. This helps to avoid radar systems which generally point at a fixed spot in the sky - in America's case, over the North Pole.

Meanwhile, China  has also unveiled a hypersonic medium-range missile, the DF-17, in 2019, which can travel around 2,000 kilometres and can carry nuclear warheads.

In October, China deployed the DF 17 missile to coastal areas in preparation for a possible invasion of Taiwan.  

The weapon has a maximum range of 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) and is capable of achieving speeds of up to 7,680 miles per hour (12,360 kph) - or 10 times the speed of sound - while carrying a nuclear warhead, according to previous reports.

It has been billed as 'a death sentence' to aircraft carriers within its range.

Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound in the upper atmosphere - or about 6,200 km per hour (3,850 mph). This is slower than an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the shape of a hypersonic glide vehicle allows it to manoeuvre toward a target or away from defences.

Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defences mechanisms.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit. 

China on Monday insisted that the test in August was a routine one for a spacecraft rather than a missile.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11529921/Pentagon-fires-hypersonic-missile-travel-five-times-speed-sound-B-52.html
1;Biden shuts down suggestions he is sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and promises to keep sending 'billions' in equipment to Kyiv at Toys for Tots event - where he pretends to get on a bike and Jill apologizes for having laryngitis;"President Joe Biden on Monday shot down a report he was considering sending U.S. troops to the Ukraine and said he was sending 'billions' in materials to the embattled nation.

'No we're sending materials like we have - billions of dollars,' Biden told DailyMail.com at an event for Toys for Tots that he was attending with first lady Jill Biden.

NBC News reported the administration was discussing whether to send a small number of U.S. troops to the Ukraine. It reported some U.S. boots are on the ground in two locations outside Kyiv to check on the use of U.S. supplies The Pentagon wants to send more. Biden dismissed that. His focus on Monday was the charity event, which brings in millions of donations in toys for less fortunate children during the holiday season.

The President got into the holiday spirit, hopping on a bicycle as he came into the gym at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, Virginiay, where piles of toys were waiting.

He helped the kids sort donations into various boxes. 

During the event, Jill Biden apologized for having laryngitis and brought one of the kids up to read an excerpt from The Grinich Who Stole Christmas in her place. The first lady sounded hoarse and cleared her throat several times as she spoke about how seeing the children help out makes 'my heart grow three sizes as well.' Ahead of the charity drive, Biden participated in a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and leaders of the G7 about Russia's invasion.

In the 10 months since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, the U.S. has passed three separate packages equating $67.3 billion in military, humanitarian and government aid. 

Biden has proposed a fourth wave of financial assistance as part of next year's funding package, which would include another $37.7 billion and, if passed, it would bring the total assistance to a whopping $105.5 billion in less than one year. 

His focus in the afternoon, however, was on the Toys for Tots event.

He chuckled as he mounted the bike, which comes after he fell off his bicycle in June when he was at his beach home in Rehoboth. The president was unhurt, however. And he got back in the seat in August when he was on Kiawah Island, South Carolina, going for a beach ride.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11529351/Biden-shuts-suggestions-sending-U-S-troops-Ukraine.html
1;Putin SCRAPS his annual live TV press conference in apparent bid to avoid being quizzed over failing Ukraine invasion;"Vladimir Putin has scrapped his annual live television press conference in an apparent bid to avoid being quizzed over his failing invasion of Ukraine.

The Russian president has held a press conference in December most years of his rule, that began in 2000. Last year, he spoke for more than four hours.

However, having ordered his troops across the border on February 24 expecting a swift victory, he has since suffered a series of embarrassing defeats. The cancellation of the conference suggests he is hoping to avoid public scrutiny. 'There will not be (a press conference) before the New Year,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He added that Putin 'regularly speaks to the press, including on foreign visits', but gave no reason for the break with tradition.  During the media gathering - a major political event in the country - Putin takes questions from the press and the public in a marathon that usually lasts several hours, but could have faced tough questions this year on his disastrous invasion.

He routinely faces questions from 500-plus Russian and also foreign journalists. In 2019, a record 1,895 journalists were accredited. The major end of year session usually takes place between 14 and 23 December.

The decision came even though reports suggest he had already decided that Western media should be banned from the event amid the war in Ukraine.

The moves mean he is not even ready to face Russian journalists in the glare of a major live event and be openly quizzed about his war.

Peskov said Putin would find a way to communicate with the Kremlin 'pool', mainly Uber-loyalist journalists, many from state media, despite aborting the live session which was one of the highlights of his year. 

He also indicated a press conference could take place in the New Year, but gave no specified date or format. Putin had earlier postponed his annual live Direct Line question and answer session with ordinary Russians amid evident concerns he would face complaints over the war and his chaotic partial mobilisation.

Moscow has seen 100,000-plus of its soldiers dead or wounded since the invasion began, and has lost thousands of tanks and other items of military hardware.

Peskov also failed to give a date for Putin to address the senate - or Federation Council - which is a formal annual duty under the constitution. 

The announcement will fuel suspicions that Putin is running scared of scrutiny of his handling of the war which he calls a special military operation.

It will also raise questions over whether - at the age of 70 - he is sufficiently healthy to endure the long sessions when he is under the world's gaze. 

Putin is also not to host a New Year celebration, Peskov announced.

There has been significant speculation about Putin's health, including persistent - but unproven - rumours that he is suffering from cancer, and other conditions.

There are also rumours that he underwent minor surgery at the weekend after an alleged fall down the stairs at an official residence. 

The Kremlin denied he suffered a fall.

In its daily update on the military situation on Monday, Ukraine's General Staff said its forces had repelled Russian assaults on four settlements in the eastern Donetsk region and on eight settlements in the adjacent Luhansk region. Russia kept up its attacks on Bakhmut, which is now largely in ruins, Avdiivka, and Lyman, and launched two missile strikes against civilian infrastructure in Kostyantynivka, all in the Donetsk region - one of four that Moscow claims to have annexed from Ukraine after 'referendums' branded illegal by Kyiv.

Ukraine has said Russian forces are suffering huge losses on the eastern front in brutal fighting that is also taking its toll on its own troops.

But as Russia continues to hurl what is left of its offensive power at entrenched Ukrainian positions in and around Bakhmut, experts have wondered whether the losses in manpower and equipment will match the potential prize.

'We are scratching our heads,' a Western official told AFP this week when asked about Russia's focus on Bakhmut. 'We don't know the answer.'

Elsewhere, Russian forces carried out more than 60 attacks from rocket salvo systems targeting the civilian infrastructure in Kherson, the southern city liberated by Ukrainian forces last month, and Ukrainian troops based there.

Russia also shelled settlements along the Zaporizhzhia frontline in southern central Ukraine, it said, while Ukrainian forces hit Russian control points, munitions warehouses and other targets.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11529239/Putin-SCRAPS-annual-live-TV-press-conference.html
0;'I'm proud to support this excellent campaign': Rishi Sunak hails Mail drive to tackle children's cancer;"Rishi Sunak today declares that he is ‘proud’ to support the Daily Mail’s children’s cancer campaign.

Praising this paper’s partnership with Cancer Research UK, the Prime Minister said more needed to be done to beat childhood cancer and gave his full backing to the ‘excellent’ cause.

The Mail has teamed up with Cancer Research UK to launch the Fighting to Beat Children’s Cancer campaign, which is raising money for research into children and young people’s cancers. The Government announced last month that it was committing ?22.5million to develop new therapies, including targeted vaccines, as well as finding methods of earlier diagnosis. Mr Sunak said: ‘I’m proud to support the excellent Fighting to Beat Children’s Cancer campaign led by the Daily Mail and Cancer Research UK.

‘The NHS is diagnosing many more patients with cancer at an earlier stage than before but we need to do more to improve treatment and outcomes, particularly amongst children.

‘That is why we’re investing tens of millions of pounds in life-saving cancer research and opening over 100 community diagnostic centres across the country, delivering two million tests, scans and checks locally.’

Mr Sunak added: ‘Together we can beat cancer and the Fighting to Beat Children’s Cancer campaign is a hugely welcome contribution to that effort.’

The Government wants to follow the success of strategies that were used to secure and roll out the Covid vaccine.

The funding will form part of the NHS Cancer Programme, which aims to spot three quarters of cancers at stage one or two by 2028.

The programme also aims to help 55,000 more people each year to survive for at least five years after diagnosis.

Cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease in youngsters in the UK, killing one in five of those diagnosed – around 500 a year.

Cancer Research UK estimates that cases will rise by a fifth by 2040.

All money raised will support the charity’s work on cancers affecting young people, so that more 0-24 year olds can survive with a good quality of life. Girl of 13 beats leukaemia in world-first clinical trial 

By Matt Powell for The Daily Mail

A 13-year-old girl has been cleared of her terminal cancer after a world-first trial involving a revolutionary type of medicine.

Alyssa had undergone chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant – but her leukaemia remained.

The teenager from Leicester then received genetically-edited T-cells in the first use of the therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London.

Doctors said that without the treatment her next step would have been palliative care, but within a month, Alyssa went into remission. Speaking before the experimental treatment, Alyssa said: ‘Once I do it, people will know what they need to do, one way or another, so doing this will help people – of course I’m going to do it.’

The pre-manufactured cells, from a healthy volunteer donor, were edited using new technology to allow them to hunt down and kill cancerous T-cells without attacking each other. T-cells are white blood cells which move around the body to find and destroy defective cells.

Alyssa was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) last year. It is the most common cancer in children and young people, affecting 500 each year, and the survival rate for those whose T-ALL has relapsed is just 10 per cent.

Alyssa was the first patient in the T-cell clinical trial, which was funded by the Medical Research Council. Twenty-eight days after being given the treatment, Alyssa was in remission, and was able to have a second bone marrow transplant. She is said to be ‘doing well at home’ and continues with follow-up monitoring at Great Ormond Street. Scientists working on the clinical trial hope to recruit up to ten T-ALL patients who have exhausted all conventional options.

Professor Waseem Qasim, consultant immunologist at GOSH, said: ‘This is a great demonstration of how, with expert teams and infrastructure, we can link cutting-edge technologies in the lab with real results in the hospital for patients. It’s our most sophisticated cell engineering so far and paves the way for other new treatments and ultimately better futures for sick children.’

Alyssa’s mother Kiona said the family were ‘on a strange cloud nine’.

She added: ‘Hopefully this can prove the research works and they can offer it to more children – all of this needs to have been for something.’";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11526905/Rishi-Sunak-hails-Mail-drive-tackle-childrens-cancer.html
0;Senate scrambles to avoid a shutdown by trying to pass a ONE-WEEK funding bill: Democrat Chuck Schumer says extension could help negotiations over spending bill that could climb to $1.5 TRILLION;"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York announced Monday that he's willing to bring a week-long spending bill, also known as a continuing resolution, to the floor to stop a federal government shutdown - a signal that negotiations between the two parties have been fruitful but won't be hashed out before Friday's midnight deadline. 

Kicking the can down the road by a week would give lawmakers until nearly Christmas Eve to come to agreement on a year-long budget bill to fund the government and head home for the holidays - or pass a longer continuing resolution that would give Republicans more say over the funding in the House. 

Known as the omnibus package, the legislation consists of several smaller appropriations bill that would keep the government running for a year and only requires one vote in the House and the Senate. 'Later this week members should be prepared to take quick action on a CR, a one-week CR, so we can give appropriators more time to finish a full funding bill before the holidays,' Schumer said. 'I am optimistic we could take action on a CR rather quickly and avoid the shutdown that neither side wants.' 

While the two sides are still bickering over a topline number, they have already agreed to $847 billion for the Pentagon, as was passed in the House in the yearly National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) last week. That funding, a roughly 10 percent increase over last year's level, hinges on the passing of an omnibus package.

Top GOP appropriator Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said last week the two sides were still $26 billion apart on non-defense spending in the roughly $1.5 trillion package.  

In opening floor remarks Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky did not reject the idea of a one-week bill but said that if Democrats don't drop their request for higher non-defense spending, the only option would be to punt to next year the unfinished fiscal year 2023 funding bill. 

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy of California has been pushing for this option, as his part will take control of the lower chamber on January 3. 

'The commander in chief's own party does not get to demand a pile of unrelated goodies in exchange for doing their job and funding our armed forces,' McConnell said.

'Our Democratic colleagues have already spent two years massively, massively increasing domestic spending using party-line reconciliation bills outside the normal appropriations process,' he added, referring to the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act.  Democrats control both chambers of Congress at the moment, but Schumer needs 10 Senate Republican votes to move a funding measure forward in the legislative process. 

McCarthy isn't keen to move quickly.

'We're 28 days away from Republicans having the gavel. We would be stronger in every negotiation,' McCarthy said in a Dec. 5 interview on Fox News. 'Wait till we're in charge.'

Some Senate Republicans agree with him. 'Let's pass a CR that will allow a Republican House to pass a more fiscally responsible spending bill early next year,' tweeted GOP Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on Friday. 

The staunchly conservative Rep. Chip Roy of Texas urged Senate Republicans to 'vote no' on the week-long bill and hold out for a bill that extends into the next Congress.

The idea has Democrats worried, however,

Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he is concerned Republicans will hold government funding 'hostage' in order to make cuts to social programs.

'Clearly, what I worry about is Republican efforts to hold hostage next year, if we don't get an omnibus bill passed, to hold - hold hostage the government in order to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And that, I will vigorously oppose,' he said Sunday on CNN.

With no long-term deal in sight, officials may be working until Christmas Eve and into the New Year. If lawmakers can't come to a deal for Friday night, as required by law, the government will begin to close down nonessential services and start worker furloughs. 

The last shutdown happened in January 2019 in what became a record 35-day shutdown in government services that nearly resulted in the closing of major airports on the East Coast. 

This year, Republicans want to lower spending on social programs and argue that bills like President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and the $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act have made inflation worse.

'Our commander-in-chief and his party have spent huge sums on domestic priorities outside the normal appropriations process without a penny for the Defense Department. Obviously, we won't allow them to now hijack the government funding process, too, and take our troops hostage for even more liberal spending,' McConnell said on the Senate floor on Thursday. 

Democrats counter they were necessary to help the country recover from the pandemic. 

And they say those earlier bills should not mean less money for domestic spending in the new budget.

In a sign of progress over the weekend, Democrats decided not to produce their own version of a spending bill that Republicans had seen that as a threat.

Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, reversed course on Sunday night, saying 'sufficient progress' was made in the bipartisan talks.

'Chairman Leahy feels that sufficient progress in negotiations took place over the weekend to delay the introduction of the omnibus appropriations bill for the time being,' a Senate Democratic aide told Reuters. 'Bipartisan and bicameral negotiations continue. Tied to the funding measure is an election overhaul bill designed to avoid another January 6th, which Senate leaders want to attach to the omnibus package that funds the government. 

Also this week, the Senate is likely to take up the annual defense authorization bill after the House approved it last week.

This year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes $847 billion for the Defense Department and roughly $30 billion for nuclear activities in the Department of Energy. It also includes a 4.6 per cent pay raise for the troops.

The House passed the bill in a bipartisan 350-80 vote on Thursday.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11530871/Senate-scrambles-avoid-shutdown-trying-pass-ONE-WEEK-funding-bill.html
0;Look, no training wheels! Biden pretends to get on a child-sized bike and plays with handlebars at Toys-for-Tots event - six months after falling off during a weekend trip to Delaware;"President Joe Biden tried out a child-sized bike on Monday, six months after he fell off the adult version and injured himself.

Biden, who was helping organize toys at a Toys for Tots event, was in the holiday spirit, smiling and visibly joking with children who were at the charity event.

The president - an avid cyclist - tried out a couple of different rides.  He mounted one bicycle, a larger version, as soon as he came into the gym at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, Virginia, where piles of toys were waiting.

Biden, 80, chuckled and waved to the crowd, showing no sign of the distress he showed in June, when he fell off his bike during a weekend at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The president was unhurt. And he got back in the seat in August when he was on Kiawah Island, South Carolina, going for a beach ride. 

Later Monday, as he helped the kids sort donations into various boxes, Biden saw a smaller-sized bicycle, which he tried out for size. It was a bit too short for the 6-foot president, so he hopped back off and let the kids distribute it to its proper spot. Biden was joined by first lady Jill Biden at the charity event, which brings in millions of donations in toys for less fortunate children during the holiday season.

She apologized for having laryngitis and brought one of the kids up to read an excerpt from The Grinch Who Stole Christmas in her place. 

The first lady sounded hoarse and cleared her throat several times as she spoke about how seeing the children help out makes 'my heart grow three sizes as well.' 

Both she and the president spoke of the importance of family. 

'Jill and I know how much you sacrifice,' President Biden said to the gathered Marines and the children. 'When our son Beau was deployed to Iraq, it was hard to look at the empty chair at our table every night during the holidays. And it was hard for our granddaughters when their dad wasn't there on Christmas morning.' 'You have to be brave, even when your mommies and daddies are far away. They're so proud of you,' Biden said to the kids.

The atmosphere was festive with a Marine band playing holiday carols and the children dressed in bright holiday colors. 

The Bidens handed out boxes of presidential M&Ms with Joe Biden's signature on them to the children.

The first couple and about 40 kids helped sort toys into boxes for distribution. 

Biden carried a few boxes to the barrels for sorting, but he spent most of his time speaking with the children and various Marines. 

Children had him and the first lady surrounded during the visit. Afterward the first couple posed for photos.  Toys for Tots is a program run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve which distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas. The program was founded in 1947 by reservist Major Bill Hendricks.

Jill Biden participated in the toy drive last year also, during her first year in the White House. 

Currently Toys for Tots, distributes an average of 18 million toys to 7 million less fortunate children annually.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11530501/Biden-pretends-child-sized-bike-six-months-fall.html
0;Twist in Melissa Caddick case as luxury fashion brand Christian Dior is ordered to reveal the missing conwoman's spending habits and hand over cash held in her name;"Luxury fashion brand Christian Dior has been ordered to release funds it holds in the name of infamous conwoman Melissa Caddick, as well as 10 years of records revealing her spending habits.

The expensive lifestyle of the unlicensed financial adviser has been under intense scrutiny since she disappeared without a trace two years ago in the midst of an investigation into her business.

The 49-year-old fraudster vanished from her luxury Sydney home more than two years ago, on November 12, 2020. She mysteriously disappeared in the early hours of the morning after the Australian Security and Investment Commission and the Australian Federal Police raided her $15m home. The former financial adviser did not have her phone, wallet, or keys when she went missing, never to be seen or heard from again.

The 49-year-old was declared dead four months after her disappearance in February 2021 when a decaying foot was found on a beach on the NSW south coast, hundreds of kilometres from Sydney. DNA extracted from the grisly find matched Ms Caddick.

She is accused of swindling about $23m from more than 70 clients while acting as their financial Adviser. Corporate watchdog ASIC alleges the fraudster funnelled the funds from her client's accounts into her own bank accounts to fund her lavish lifestyle.

Since her disappearance, court-appointed receivers Jones Partners have attempted to unravel her widespread scam.

Liquidators are attempting to recover the tens of millions of dollars that Ms Caddick misappropriated between 2012-19. Lawyers representing the receivers, Christian Dior, Ms Caddick's husband Anthony Koletti and her parents appeared in the Federal Court on Monday.

The court was told that Jones Partners were asking Christian Dior to release 10 years of records related to the missing conwoman, dating back to her first investment in 2011.

Lawyer for Jones Partners, Nicola Bailey, told the court the extensive list of invoices, receipts and statements of account were necessary to encapsulate 'a complete history as best as possible of all of the investor funds'.

However, Ben Katecar SC argued his client Christian Dior Australia would be forced to reveal privileged information 'for the purposes of someone else's dispute'.

'The position of Christian Dior Australia is that it is not a party to this litigation, it is an outsider,' he said.

'The information contained in these documents is proprietary. Christian Dior's business relies on confidentiality.' The luxury designer became embroiled in the court case when it disclosed last month that it was holding money and documents in Ms Caddick's name.

Justice Brigitte Markovic said releasing the documents relating to the conwoman would not disclose Christian Dior's 'competitive way of doing business'.

'This is only information in regards to one client and I don't think it's any secret Ms Caddick was a client of Christian Dior,' she said.

'I don't imagine any much can be done with (the invoices).'

She told the court the receivers would be able to release the amount of money the luxury fashion house received from the fraudster.

'It's not your client's money,' Justice Markovic said.

'As I understand, you hold it on behalf of a client, and... it's no more secret than the amount her jewellery may have sold for.' If Jones Partners wanted to report more granular details to the creditors, Justice Markovic ordered them to provide Christian Dior with three days notice.

'The receivers will need to exercise a degree of caution,' she warned.

Jones Partners will be granted access to the 10 years of records, although the court was told documents from 2021 would be excluded from the cache. The judge ordered Christian Dior to hand over the records and all funds held in Ms Caddick's name within two weeks.

According to the court documents, surrendered records include details of any money or goods held on the fraudster's behalf, such as deposits or goods held pending payment.

The luxury designer is also directed to share financial documents issued to Ms Caddick, including tax invoices, records of any payments, accounts statements and receipts. The court heard discussions about the fraudster's contested assets could not be adequately addressed until the inquest into her death was finalised.

Justice Markovic acknowledged the findings were set to be handed down in April next year.

The fight over the conwoman's assets will return to court on April 19 next year.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11530813/Mellissa-Caddick-case-Christian-Dior-ordered-hand-cash-held-fraudsters-name.html
0;Two former Denver Broncos stars will donate their brains to medical research when they die to study brain disease that’s associated with repeated head hits;"Two ex-NFL stars have said they are willing to donate their brains to science in aid of research into a degenerative disease associated with repeated head hits.

Former Denver Broncos quarterback Jeb Putzier, 43, and tightend Jake Plummer, 47, both believe repeated concussions during their careers may shorten their lives.

A 2017 Boston University study found that 99 percent of ex-NFL players who donated their brain to science were diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) after death. CTE, previously known as 'punch drunk' disorder, is a brain disease suspected to be caused by repeated blows to the head. Symptoms include memory loss, slurring of speech, and some of the same symptoms as Parkinson's disease. But it doesn't always appear on brain scans, making volunteers like Putzier and Plummer essential to scientists' research into the disease.

Putzier told Fox that he sustained around 1,000 concussions during a decade-long NFL career.

He said: 'I have trouble with my eyes. It’s hard for me. I don’t read left to right like that anymore. I was an English literature major and I can’t read anymore.'

Plummer added that he's now having second thoughts about whether he should have played football at all.

He said: 'When I got out of the league and I had hip surgeries, and Junior Seau took his life and I went and watched the movie ""Concussion"". Yeah, I was starting to wonder why I even played the game.'

Plummer retired in 2008 after a decade-long NFL career.

Putzier hung up his helmet in 2010 after eight years in the NFL. 

An autopsy earlier this year confirmed that ex-Bronco Demaryius Thomas had CTE when he collapsed and died aged just 33.

Thomas was driving 70mph when he flipped his car in 2019 and ultimately cracked the windshield with his head. 

The Jaws of Life were needed to extract Thomas from the vehicle, according to the New York Times.

'He had two different conditions in parallel,' Boston University's Dr. Ann McKee told the newspaper, explaining that seizures are not typically linked with CTE. Thomas was suffering from 'memory loss, paranoia and isolation' in the final years of his life, all of which are indicators of CTE.  His paranoia became so severe, Thomas's father Bobby said, his son never left home without a gun.

Thomas was one of more than 300 ex-NFL players diagnosed with the brain disease by Boston University's CTE Center.

Meanwhile, the NCAA was found not to blame for the death of an ex-USC football player diagnosed with permanent brain damage.

Matthew Gee, a linebacker on USC's 1990 Rose Bowl-winning squad, endured an estimated 6,000 hits as a college athlete, lawyers for his widow said. 

They alleged those impacts caused permanent brain damage and led to cocaine and alcohol abuse that eventually killed him at age 49. 

Gee died in his sleep at his Simi Valley, California home on December 31, 2018.

The NCAA, the governing body of US college sports, said it had nothing to do with Gee's death, which it said was a sudden cardiac arrest brought on by untreated hypertension and acute cocaine toxicity. Hundreds of wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits have been brought by college football players against the NCAA in the past decade, but Gee's was the first one to reach a jury. 

The suit alleged that hits to the head led to CTE, a link that failed to persuade the jury in the $55million ruling.

Judge Terry Green told jurors in Los Angeles Superior Court they 'made history' in the first case of its kind.

The verdict likely gives the NCAA more leverage in future cases, said Dan Lust, a sports law attorney and professor at New York Law School.

'Any plaintiff's attorney is going to think twice before putting all the chips on the table and pushing them to the middle and saying, ''We're going to take our case to trial and see what happens,''' Lust said.

0;Britain's December strikes: Who is striking, why, and for how long? What are the government doing about it? How will it impact your Christmas? Everything you need to know about the new winter of discontent;"Royal Mail staff, nurses, paramedics, rail workers and Border Force officials will all stage walkouts over jobs, pay and conditions this month as Brits prepare for mayhem over Christmas. 

December is being described as the 'new winter of discontent' - with bus workers, baggage handlers, environment agency staff and paramedics also taking action. 

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden called on unions to call off the 'damaging' strikes. But the government is being urged to listen to workers' demands, negotiate with unions and come to an agreement that will pause the disruption.  Who is striking and when?
- Staff at Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff airports will strike for eight days from December 23 to New Year's Eve. 

- More than 40,000 Rail, Maritime and Transport union members plan to take industrial action on December 13, 14, 16, 17, 24-27. Action by the Unite Union will also take place on December 23 and 24. 

- Royal College of Nursing members are due to take part in unprecedented strike action on December 15 and December 20.

- The CWU has formally notified Royal Mail they plan to call on their members who collect, sort and deliver parcels and letters to take national strike action on December 14, 15, 23 and 24. 

- GMB, Unite and Unison confirmed their members will walk out from nine of England's ten ambulance services, plus Wales, on December 21. Ambulance workers represented by GMB will also strike on December 28.

- UNISON Environment Agency workers will be 'working to rule' continuously beginning December 12. UNISON is also asking members to withdraw from filling voluntary Incident Response Rosters from midnight-to-midnight on December 12, 14, 16, 20 and 22.

- National Highways employees, who plan, design, build, operate and maintain the country's roads will take part in strikes on  December 16-17, 22-25, 30-31.

- Almost 1,000 bus drivers employed by Abellio will strike on December 9, 10, 16 and 17. 

- Heathrow Airport baggage handlers will take action on December 16 from 4am for 72 hours. Border force - Why are the strikes happening and will your holiday be affected?
Staff at Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff airports will strike for eight days from December 23 to New Year's Eve. 

The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has warned of 'extraordinary disruption' after its members, including immigration and visa officials, voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay.

It raises the prospect of hours long queues at airports and ports over the festive break, when millions will be travelling cross country and abroad to see their families and friends.

Plans for military staff and civil servants to cover for striking Border Force staff at airports and ports are among the contingency measures set to be discussed at a Cobra meeting on Monday.

People are being told to check their flight status with their airline before travelling.

Transport - Which companies are affected and why? 
A new set of strikes by rail workers across December will massively disrupt travel across Britain in the run-up to Christmas.

People looking to travel by train this month face one of the worst series of strikes in decades, as more than 40,000 Rail, Maritime and Transport union members plan to take industrial action.

General secretary Mick Lynch said: 'We've been faced with an extremely detrimental offer and our members simply aren't in a position to accept the changes the companies have put on the table.'

Strikes will take place on the following dates:

Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 December 2022 - action by the RMT union.

Friday 16 and Saturday 17 December 2022 - action by the RMT union. 

18:00 Saturday 24 to 06:00 Tuesday 27 December - action by the RMT union.

Friday 23 and Saturday 24 December - action by Unite union. This will affect East Midlands Railway.

Services will be cancelled or severely disrupted across strike dates, so it is likely that there will be a very limited service on these days in or out of London - with no trains at all on some routes.

Non-union members and managers will enable a service to run between 7.30am and 6.30pm across about half the rail network.

Around 80 per cent of services across the UK are likely to be cancelled on strike days. Nurses - Why has the dispute ended in unprecedented action?
Royal College of Nursing members are due to take part in unprecedented strike action on December 15 and December 20, with tens of thousands of nursing staff expected to take industrial action.

Ministers refused to meet the Royal College of Nursing's pay request, the equivalent of 17 per cent for every nurse, or ?6,000 for the average medic earning around ?35,000. 

A Royal College of Nursing spokesperson said: 'The urgent meeting that the Government would really benefit from convening is with us. Negotiate now and pause these strikes.' The Government has been accused of playing a 'dangerous game' over nursing strikes, as it ignored an offer from trade unions to 'press pause' on a walk-out in exchange for pay talks.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had offered to suspend the proposed action if Health Secretary Steve Barclay would agree to negotiate properly on pay.

But that proposal went unheeded, with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly earlier robustly defending the independent review process that the Government has said should determine pay increases.

'The Government is looking desperate and appears to be misleading the public,' RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen said.

'The Foreign Secretary is completely wrong to say this is a matter for the NHS and not ministers. The Government makes the decisions on pay for NHS staff. They must correct the record and start being honest.

'My offer of negotiations has not been accepted today - the Government is playing a dangerous game.

'Serious negotiations, where both sides give some ground, are the only way out of this.'

Mr Cleverly had earlier defended his Cabinet colleague, who he said had offered to meet the nurses.

'He has said he is willing to meet them,' the Cabinet minister told Sky News.

'Ultimately, independent bodies are there for a reason - it is to take the politics out of this sort of stuff.'

Meanwhile, Mr Barclay used an editorial for the Sun on Sunday to criticise the planned strikes amid serious pressures on the NHS.

The strike is expected to cause major disruption to the health service in the run-up to Christmas, with ambulance workers also set to strike on December 21.

Nurses and other nursing staff will take action at half of the locations in England where the legal mandate was reached for strikes, every NHS employer except one in Wales and throughout Northern Ireland.

'In a winter when we're worrying about Covid, flu and Strep A - on top of the Covid backlogs - I am deeply concerned about the risks of strike action to patients,' Mr Barclay said.

'We are working hard to make sure patients experience as little disruption as possible. But with the NHS already under pressure due to the Covid pandemic and coming winter, the risks to patients will be significant,' he wrote.

Labour accused the Government of spoiling for a fight with nurses.

Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News that the Government needs to 'grow up and get around the table' after the Royal College of Nursing and the Unison union said they will suspend strikes if ministers are prepared to meet and talk about pay.

'I think that is an offer that's too good to refuse and I want the Government to explain why they aren't prepared to even sit down and talk even though they know patients will experience real disruption as a result of strike action,' he said.   

Ambulance workers - Which trusts are involved and why - and what does it mean for patients? 
GMB, Unite and Unison confirmed their members will walk out from nine of England's ten ambulance services, plus Wales, on December 21. 

The only NHS ambulance trust unaffected will be East of England. 

Ambulance workers represented by GMB will also strike on December 28.

Unison's head of health Sara Gorton said: 'The wage rise given to health workers this year simply hasn't been enough to stop staff leaving in droves. 

'Without enough employees in the NHS, patients will go on waiting too long for ambulances and for treatment to start,' she said.

'Instead of putting plans in place for the strike days, ministers should be concentrating all their efforts on ending the disputes.'

GMB members will strike at the:

South West Ambulance Service;

South East Coast Ambulance Service;

North West Ambulance Service;

South Central Ambulance Service;

North East Ambulance Service;

East Midlands Ambulance Service;

West Midlands Ambulance Service;

Welsh Ambulance Service; and

Yorkshire Ambulance Service

NHS ambulance trusts affected by strike action will draw up plans detailing the number of staff they believe they need on in order to provide 'life and limb' cover. Unions anticipate the level of cover requested by some trusts could be higher than that provided on some non-strike days, given underlying staff shortages.

Unison, Unite and GMB will agree among themselves which staff do and do not work. The Army may be brought in to drive ambulances if needed.

Patients dialling 999 may face a longer wait to get through to a call handler but calls will be diverted to other regions if necessary to limit delays.

Calls will be triaged as usual, with unions pledging to respond to 'life and limb' calls. Category one calls include 'life-threatening' injuries and illnesses, including incidents where a patient's heart has stopped or they are not breathing. Category two calls are 'emergency' calls, such as heart attacks and strokes.

Those with less critical illnesses may not receive an ambulance response and could be told to make their own way to hospital or to seek care elsewhere.

Patients who rely on NHS ambulance services to transport them to hospital appointments may also be forced to make alternative travel arrangements.

Concerns have been raised that elderly people 'may well die' if there is no cover for trips and falls during ambulance strikes.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay said there was 'still a question' over whether ambulance services would cover all emergency callouts during strikes. He said officials planned to meet on Thursday to discuss coverage of category two callouts - which cover heart attacks, strokes, epilepsy and burns.

But the minister told Sky News that falls tended to come under a category three emergency and 'at the moment the trade unions are saying those things wouldn't be covered' but 'the indication from the trade unions' is that conditions such as heart attacks will be covered. Royal Mail - What have they asked for and how will Christmas post be affected?
Royal Mail workers will strike in a long running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.

The workers will now walk out on December 23 and 24, in addition to December 1, 9, 11, 14 and 15, the Communication Workers Union said in a statement, exacerbating concerns that Christmas post could be severely delayed.

Nearly 99 per cent of CWU members voted in favour of strike action after rejecting a 2 per cent pay deal.

'The CWU want a negotiated settlement with Royal Mail Group and will continue to engage the company to that end,' a spokesperson said.

'But those in charge of Royal Mail need to wake up and realise we won't allow them to destroy the livelihoods of postal workers.'

The postal service is looking to switch from a six-days-a-week letter delivery service to five, covering Monday to Friday only, under its Universal Service agreement.

The group will, however, look to maintain a seven-day parcel delivery service.

CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: 'Royal Mail bosses are risking a Christmas meltdown because of their stubborn refusal to treat their employees with respect.

'Postal workers want to get on with serving the communities they belong to, delivering Christmas gifts and tackling the backlog from recent weeks.

'But they know their value, and they will not meekly accept the casualisation of their jobs, the destruction of their conditions and the impoverishment of their families.' A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'The CWU know full well that in a business losing more than ?1 million a day, we need to agree changes to the way we work so that we can fund the pay offer of up to 9% we have already made.

'While the CWU refuses to accept the need for change, it's our customers and our people who suffer. Strike action has already cost our people ?1,200 each. The money allocated to the pay deal risks being eaten away by the costs of further strike action.

'The CWU is striking at our busiest time, deliberately holding Christmas to ransom for our customers, businesses and families across the country.

'We are doing everything we can to deliver Christmas for our customers and settle this dispute. During the last strike days, we delivered more than 700,000 parcels, and more than 11,000 delivery and processing staff returned to work. We recovered our service quickly, but the task becomes more challenging as Christmas nears.

'We remain willing to talk at any time about our best and final offer and urge the CWU to call off their damaging strike action.'

Environment Agency - how will strikes work and why?
Thousands of Environment Agency workers in England are to take industrial action in the coming weeks, including stopping attending incidents such as floods, water pollution, spills, waste fires and fly-tipping.

Members of the Unison union will be working to rule from Monday on different days up to and over Christmas in a dispute over pay.

This means they will only work their contracted hours, taking all scheduled breaks and rest in full between shifts, and will not accept any unpaid work at this busy time of year for the agency.

In addition, employees will refuse to volunteer for 'on call' cover for several days.

Unison said high vacancy levels at the agency are piling extra pressure on staff.

Wages have fallen behind rising costs for many years and this year workers were offered a 2% rise plus a ?345 payment, said the union.

Where there is a threat to life from incidents such as a major flood, officers will step in as emergency 'life and limb cover' has been agreed.

Unison's head of environment Donna Rowe-Merriman said: 'Staff are proud to play a vital role in keeping communities safe, but feel constantly taken for granted by a Government that has persistently failed to invest in the Environment Agency.

'Wages there have been held down for years, prompting many experienced workers to quit for better paid work elsewhere. But as more leave, the pressures increase on those staff left behind. And so it goes on.

'Severe weather and concerns about pollution mean the agency's work is more important now than ever. But the blame for any disruption must be laid solely at the Government's door.

'The solution is a wage rise that's a better match for inflation. Otherwise, staff will continue to resign, leaving even fewer that can be called upon in emergencies. The consequences for people living in areas prone to flooding are unthinkable.'

An Environment Agency spokesperson said: 'We have plans in place to minimise any disruption to our essential work to protect the environment and respond to incidents.

'As a public-sector organisation, the Environment Agency remains bound by the pay policy of the government of the day.'   Road maintenance - Action will coincide with strikes on the railways 
PCS members working on England's highways have announced 12 days' strike action over Christmas and the New Year - December 16-17, 22-25, 30-31, January 3-4, 6-7.

The National Highways employees, who plan, design, build, operate and maintain the country's roads, will take part in a series of staggered strikes from 16 December to 7 January.

The action, which risks bringing the road network to a standstill, will coincide with planned strikes by RMT members on the railways.

PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'We know our members' action could inconvenience travellers who plan to visit their relatives over the festive period, but our members have been placed in this situation by a government that won't listen to its own workforce.'

Bus workers - which part of the country will strikes affect and which have been called off?
Almost 1,000 bus drivers employed by Abellio will strike on December 16 and 17.

The action will primarily affect buses in south and west London. Striking workers will be from depots in Battersea, Beddington, Hayes, Southall, Twickenham and Walworth.

Some of the bus strikes have been called off.

Unite said its members, employed by Metroline, have accepted an 11% pay increase, which the union said was a 'significant improvement' on the 4% drivers were originally offered.

As a result of the workers accepting the improved offer, the planned strike action for later this month has been called off.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: 'This is a significant victory for our members at Metroline who by standing together and being prepared to take industrial action, have secured a greatly improved pay offer.'

Heathrow Airport baggage handlers - 

Passengers at Heathrow Airport will face festive chaos after baggage handlers voted to strike on December 16 from 4am for 72 hours.

Ground handlers employed by a private contractor at the London airport will strike in a 72-hour row over pay, as Britain prepares itself for a 'winter of discontent'.

There will be around 350 members of Unite who work for Menzies that will walk out. What if you are going abroad for Christmas?
Heathrow Airport said on Monday that it expected the vast majority of travellers will be unaffected by this month's planned strikes by Border Force workers.

'We are doing everything we can to protect a full flight schedule on strike days, so departing passengers should expect to travel as normal,' Heathrow said. 

It said arriving passengers with British, EU, U.S., Canadian and some other passports will be able to use e-gates as usual and their journeys should be largely unaffected on strike days.

Border Force has contingency measures to ensure other arriving passengers are cleared safely and as quickly as possible, Heathrow said.

A Heathrow spokesman earlier said: 'Our priority is to ensure passengers get through the border safely and as quickly as possible.

'We are working closely with airlines and Border Force on mitigation plans for potential strike action by Border Force officers and these plans will now be implemented for the notified days.

'The Home Office advises that immigration and customs checks may take longer during peak times on strike days, and Heathrow will support Border Force to minimise these impacts with the aim of processing passengers through the border as efficiently as possible.

'Passengers are advised to check their flight status with their airline before travelling. We encourage all parties to resolve this dispute quickly.'

Interior minister Suella Braverman warned last Thursday that Border Force strikes may cause travel delays, adding that people should think carefully about their plans to fly abroad. 

Will my Christmas rail travel plans be disrupted? 
The militant union chiefs have been accused of holding British people's Christmas plans to ransom after rejecting a pay offer. 

The Transport Secretary has warned that some families could face a 'virtual Christmas' due to rail strikes over the festive season.

Mark Harper hit out at rail unions over the deadlocked row. Writing for the Telegraph, Mr Harper said: 'This year, many families may have no choice but to alter their plans and have a virtual Christmas again. 

'This isn't due to a new public health pandemic, but because of rail strikes, planned by the RMT union to cause misery during the festive period.'

The Cabinet minister said that the 'dire' situation was not 'inevitable', as he said that the RMT union could end it.

What is the government doing to help? 
The Army is being sent in because the country is set to be hit by a wave of strikes over the coming weeks as Royal Mail staff, nurses, paramedics, rail employees and Border Force officials all stage walkouts over jobs, pay and conditions.

The Government confirmed that military personnel and civil servants are being trained to help step in. 

Military personnel and civil servants are being trained in case they are required to be drafted in at ports and airports, as border staff prepare to strike for eight days from December 23 to New Year's Eve. 

Military personnel will begin emergency training at hospital trusts across the country to allow them to drive ambulances during a planned walkout by paramedics next week. 

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden will on Monday lead the first of two Cobra (civil contingencies committee) meetings next week which will be attended by transport, health, home office and defence ministers.

Another meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday.

'The stance the unions have taken will cause disruption for millions of hardworking people over the coming weeks,' Mr Dowden said.

'The Government will do all it can to mitigate the impact of this action, but the only way to stop the disruption completely is for union bosses to get back round the table and call off these damaging strikes.

'Although departments are responsible for plans in individual sectors, it is right that the Cabinet Office coordinates a cross-Government response.

'I will be chairing a series of Cobra meetings over the coming weeks to ensure our plans are as robust as possible, and that disruption is kept to a minimum.'";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11528237/Britains-December-strikes-striking-long.html
0;Stunning development in Bruce Lehrmann case as under fire top prosecutor accuses the POLICE of 'aligning' themselves with his defence - as he claims Brittany Higgins felt 'bullied' by cops;"ACT Police have been accused of 'aligning' themselves with Bruce Lehrmann's defence team during his rape trial by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The ACT DPP Shane Drumgold has already raised concerns about 'political and police conduct' in the case of the former Liberal staffer.

Mr Lehrmann had been accused of raping Brittany Higgins in Parliament House in March, 2019. He has always strenuously denied the allegations. Mr Drumgold aired his complaints about police in a letter to the AFP Police chief Neil Gaughan sent on November 1. In the letter he claims the police body was 'clearly aligned with the successful defence', and had suggested the decision to do a retrial be made by someone else.

'On the discharge of the jury on the 27th of October 2022, defence barrister Steven Whybrow spoke to my junior (REDACTED) and stated that he had a meeting with the investigators and that they had suggested that he contact me and firstly suggest I was not impartial,' the DPP's letter to the AFP states, news.com.au reported. 'And consequently request that I should outsource the decision as to whether or not to re-run the trial to someone outside the office.'

Mr Lehrmann's legal team said they'd spoken to police about the bail conditions imposed on him while awaiting a second trial, that has since been abandoned.

'This is emblematic of the constant exclusive direct engagement police have had with the defence rather than the prosecution in the lead up and during the trial,' Mr Drumgold wrote in the letter. Mr Drumgold also said Ms Higgins felt 'bullied' by detectives.

'The complainant has long expressed concerns that during the investigation stage, she also felt bullied by police, who she felt were pressuring her into discontinuing the complaint,' he wrote.

Mr Gaughan said in a leaked email to police that 'the allegation the DPP has made against individual ACT policing members is untested'.

'These allegations are dealt with through the appropriate mechanisms. So I'm unable to comment further.

'Operation Covina has been a challenging case for all involved. I acknowledge the dedication, professionalism and commitment of the officers involved in the investigation.' In the same letter sent on November 1, Mr Drumgold said 'there should be a public enquiry into both political and police conduct in this matter'.

ACT Attorney-General Shane Rattenbury confirmed the matter had been referred to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity for further investigation. 

The police union earlier slammed Mr Drumgold's office for criticising the Australian Federal Police and ACT Policing who investigated the matter.

In a statement, Australian Federal Police Association president Alex Caruana said the union 'wholeheartedly' supported a judicial inquiry into Mr Lehrmann's trial.

But he said 'desperate attempts' to smear the police forces by the territory's top prosecutor were untested and the subject of an internal investigation.

It earlier emerged that police had believed there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Lehrmann.

ACT Police Manager of Criminal Investigations Detective Superintendent Scott Moller claimed in diary notes that Mr Drumgold had decided to push on with the case regardless.

He wrote down a conversation where superintendent Moller and his boss, ACT Deputy Chief Police Officer Michael Chew, warned Mr Drumgold about proceeding.

Superintendent Moller claimed there was 'insufficient evidence' while Mr Chew said he wouldn't proceed with the case if it was up to him, The Australian reported. 

'DCPO stated 'if it was my choice I wouldn't proceed. But it's not my choice. There is too much political interference',' detective superintendent Moller wrote.

'I said: 'That's disappointing given I think there is insufficient evidence'.' 

Superintendent Moller claimed investigators held 'serious concerns in relation to the strength and reliability of [Ms Higgins'] evidence but also more importantly her mental health and how any future ­prosecution may affect her ­wellbeing'.

0;Is this a sign that woke Hollywood is FINALLY listening? Yellowstone and box office blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick both nominated for Golden Globes... as awards show tries to recover from low ratings and scandals;"After years of famously snubbing fan favorites to favor high-brow movies and films, the list of the nominations for the 2023 Golden Globes contain two surprises likely to delight viewers. 

Kevin Costner has been nominated for Best Actor in a Drama series for his role as John Dutton in Yellowstone, the nostalgic, anti-woke, pro-America drama on Peacock. 

The show has gripped millions since the first season was released in 2018, but only now, after widespread outcry over it being repeatedly snubbed, is it included in the list of nominees.  The movie was a slam dunk at the box office, beating Titanic to become the seventh-highest grossing movie of all time in U.S. theaters.

Tom Cruise - who had previously vowed to return his Globes in a boycott over the Hollywood Foreign Press Association - was snubbed from the Best Actor nomination list. 

However Brendan Fraser, who also threatened a boycott, was nominated for his role in The Whale. 

Top Gun: Maverick drew in enormous box office profits of $1.4billion. Last year's Best Picture, The Power of the Dog, only grossed $417,022, however. 

There were also multiple nominations for The Crown and The White Lotus, which have dominated pop culture headlines for weeks. 

The awards show will take place on January 10 next year at The Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, hosted by comedian Jerrod Carmichael. 

Last year, NBC refused to air the ceremony in a row over organizers and those in charge of making the decisions. 

The HFPA was slammed for not having any black members, and there was also a scandal over ex-president Philip Berk allegedly groping Fraser years earlier.  It was a low point for an association that for years was known for kicking off the awards season and was known as Hollywood's biggest party. 

In 2021, a pared-back version of the event was hosted by Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. 

It failed to attract viewers, with just 6.9million tuning in compared with 18.4million the previous year. 

The Oscars suffered similarly low 2021 numbers of 10.5 million. 

Last year's 2022 show doubled viewers, thanks largely to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock on stage at the start of the broadcast. ";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11529439/Is-Hollywood-finally-listening-Gun-Yellowstone-nominated-Golden-Globes.html
0;YouTuber caught driving a 'clown car' down the highway and allegedly doing crazy stunts gives bizarre answers as he's quizzed about his dangerous antics outside court;"A YouTuber facing charges over alleged 'dangerous manoeuvres' in a clown car has given nonsense answers as he was quizzed by reporters outside court, apparently unfazed by the seriousness of the allegations.

Sunshine Coast man Sam Eyles, 29, is facing a dozen charges relating to performing the potentially life-threatening stunts and posting them to social media.

The main offences relate to a modified 'clown car' with springs on the bumper, a jerry can on the floor and shoddy brakes. Eyles is alleged to have performed various stunts in the car including repeated burnouts, front-wheel stands and even a car-versus-man tug-o'-war. On Monday Eyles faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court where his bail was continued.

As part of his bail conditions, he had to surrender his passport and must not enter any international port of departure. As he left court Eyles appeared unbothered by the charges and court proceedings, giving odd, irrelevant comments to the waiting media pack.

When asked about whether he thought he put lives at risk by performing the stunts Eyles said, 'The thing is, cos turtles smell with their feet it makes you so much better at golf.'

When a reporter asked, 'You're obviously not sorry then, are you?' he responded, 'Oh basically like cos Tom Cruise was riding his bike on top of the plane in Top Gun, it's basically like... cars are just so much faster than walking.'

Eyles then made a remark about 'purple hair on monkeys' backs in a zoo' before hopping in a car and driving off. Following his court appearance, the Youtuber shared multiple clips on his Instagram of his encounter with journalists, applauding his own comments.

'As if I'd give good answers to someone who's trying to incriminate me,' Eyles wrote alongside the post.

His YouTube channel Built Not Bought - which has more than 200,000 subscribers - also allegedly shows the vehicle crash at speed on a road at Beerwah in the Sunshine Coast hinterland before rolling down an embankment.

Mr Eyles' channel also has instructional videos on how to modify vehicles.

On September 30 a search warrant was executed at a property in Image Flat, where officers seized multiple items including the clown car. Mr Eyles was later charged with multiple offences, including the dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, careless driving, driving with an unrestrained passenger and driving a defective vehicle.

Speaking about the YouTuber's stunts, Sunshine Coast District Superintendent Craig Hawkins previously said his 'antics' put both his life and that of his friends at risk.

'Putting not only your own life at risk but those of your mates for the sake of social media notoriety is childish and selfish behaviour,' Supt Hawkins said.

'Sharing these antics with his large contingent of online followers has come at a significant financial cost, both in fines and the loss of vehicles.'

Eyles will return to court next year. ";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11530665/YouTuber-Sam-Eyles-Built-Not-Bought-faces-court-jokes-awaiting-reporters.html
0;Sweet moment father is reunited with his son in Australia after spending YEARS apart: 'I'm not crying, you're crying';"A heartwarming video shows a father and son reuniting after spending eight years apart.

Melbourne boilermaker Ross Williams had long tried to convince his dad, Greg Williams, to travel down from Yeppoon, central Queensland, and last Sunday, his dream came true.

Footage taken by loving sister Milly Fotina shows Mr Williams sneaking up behind Ross to hug him. Ross turned around to see his father and stared at him in shock while Mr Williams yelled, 'surprise!'. Ross stood to face his father wide-eyed before tearing up and hugging his dad.

'What are you doing here,' Ross asked, with Mr Williams replying: 'I'm here to see you.'

Then, stunned, Ross said: 'You're here to see me?'

The moving clip has more than 3.6 million likes on TikTok, with several commenters applauding the pair's relationship.

'Awww, his face, he was in shock. I love this,' one commenter wrote.

'There's no love on earth like your parents' love. It's ageless and healing,' another said.

'I'm not crying, you're crying,' another wrote. Mr Williams explained the story behind the special video on Monday.

'My daughter flew me to Melbourne last week to surprise her brother and put a smile on his face,' he said.

'As I never fly or leave home, his surprise was unbelievably heartwarming, to say the very least.

'He has been trying in vain to get me down there for the past eight years, and I was the last person he expected to turn around and see standing next to him.

'I love my kids, as I know we all do, but this wonderful moment with my son was so very special. He is a fantastic young man that I love and am very proud of.'

After the video was taken, the pair headed over to Mt Gambier, South Australia, to visit Mr William's hometown.

'It's been the greatest gift to have the old man come visit me in Melbourne and go for a road trip to his hometown,' Ross wrote under photos of their trip.

'Been looking forward to this since I was a fair few feet shorter.' ";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11530351/Father-Greg-Williams-fly-Yeppoon-Queensland-Melbourne-surprise-son-Ross-Williams.html
0;Young constables didn't stand a chance: Cold-blooded killers calmly walked up to wounded cops and shot them dead at near point blank range - before stealing their Glocks;"Two young constables lured to their deaths didn't stand a chance. 

Queensland Police constables Matthew Arnold, 26, and Rachel McCrow, 29, were caught off guard when they died in a hail of bullets.

The officers would have been no strangers to knocking on the doors - it was part of the job.  The officers had been carrying out 'routine missing person inquiries' on Monday at the isolated property on Wains Rd, south of Chinchilla, at about 4.40pm. 

 Queensland Police had received a special request from NSW Police regarding missing Dubbo man Nathaniel Train.  Train - a former school principal at Yorkeys Knob State School in Cairns - was hardly considered a dangerous intercept. 

Photos of him online show him smiling with young students while wearing a santa hat as part of a school fundraiser. 

Last week, NSW Police issued an appeal for public assistance to locate Train, who had not been seen in Dubbo for almost a year. 

He was supposed to be simply another missing person, whose family simply wanted him returned home safely.  

What the officers likely didn't know was that some detectives in NSW knew Train had relatives with an 'intense distrust of police'.

Train had been holed-up at his brother Gareth's home when Constables Arnold and McCrow made their final call of duty. 

While no doubt aware that every door knock could be their last, they could not have been prepared for what lay in wait.

Train's own family, who had been in contact with him while he was on the run, had called the cops themselves when he stopped communicating with them on December 4. 

They reportedly had 'serious concerns for Nathaniel’s welfare'.  While little remains known about Train's criminal history, public checks reveal he had a prior criminal history limited to traffic offences in Queensland and NSW. 

Positioned outside the brightly painted yellow weatherboard home, the two officers made their approach. 

Photographs of the Wains Road property indicate the pair would have had little place to find cover upon being fired at. 

Dressed in camouflage - as if prepared for the war they were about to declare on Queensland Police - Train and his brother Gareth opened fire from the shadows. 

Caught by surprise and stuck in the open, Constables Arnold and McCrow went to ground in the barrage of bullets. 

What happened next was the stuff of nightmares. 

If Constables Arnold and McCrow weren't already dead, they would only be alive for a few more seconds. 

A neighbour, Alan Dare, was fatally shot while attempting to go to their assistance. 

As the officers lay wounded, Constables Arnold and McCrow were seen to be ­approached by the gunmen and shot '­execution-style where they lay', The Australian reported.

The cold blooded killers then removed the dead officers' Glock pistols and looked for more victims. Two other officers, who had stood back as their colleagues went ahead, were also caught-up in the massacre. 

Another female officer managed to escape, dodging the offenders after they reportedly started a bushfire in a bid to find her.

In the job only a matter of months, she was rescued by fellow officers sent in to extract her.  

A male officer suffering a gunshot wound was taken to Chinchilla Hospital. 

The police extraction team managed to remove the bodies of the dead constables while engaging in a fierce firefight with the deranged brothers. 

Queensland Police's Special Emergency Response Team ended the siege about 11.30pm - finding the bodies of all three inside dead, including Gareth's partner.

As Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll paid tribute to the officers in an emotional press conference late Monday, Queensland Police Union President Ian Leavers described the killing of the two officers as 'ruthless, calculated and targeted execution'.

'These officers' tragic, needless and senseless murders have already been felt deeply across Queensland and all over Australia,' he wrote in a memo to police.

'Our thoughts are also with police who bravely contained and managed the subsequent operation that has now resulted in the deaths of all the offenders.'

'We are all in a state of shock and disbelief. To be here tonight and know that two brave police both under the age of 30 have needlessly lost their lives affects all our emotions.

'To know that she and he are no longer with us in what was a ruthless, calculated and targeted execution of our colleagues and loved ones brings home the very real risks that we face every single day doing our jobs.'

Flags will be flown at half mast at all police stations across Queensland on Tuesday while a floral tribute is building outside Chinchilla police station.";https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/brisbane/article-11530727/Chilling-moment-cold-blooded-killers-calmly-execute-wounded-cops-near-Chinchilla-Queensland.html

Il a fallu attendre un mois : Sam Bankman-Fried, 30 ans, le fondateur de l’empire de cryptomonnaies en faillite FTX, a ?t? arr?t? lundi 12 d?cembre aux Bahamas o? il r?sidait.

« Plus t?t dans la soir?e, les autorit?s des Bahamas ont arr?t? Samuel Bankman-Fried ? la demande du gouvernement am?ricain, sur la base d’un acte d’accusation scell? d?pos? par le district sud de New York.

Cette arrestation intervient quatre semaines apr?s l’effondrement de FTX. La plate-forme d’?change de cryptomonnaies, qui ?tait consid?r?e comme l’une des plus s?res de la plan?te, avait fait faillite en quelques jours apr?s qu’un de ses concurrents, Binance, leader du secteur, eut d?cid? de retirer ses fonds.

M. Bankman-Fried, profitant de la r?gulation particuli?rement souple des Bahamas, s’?tait servi personnellement : selon le Wall Street Journal, il avait b?n?fici? d’un pr?t personnel de 1 milliard de dollars (950 millions d’euros) tandis qu’un de ses lieutenants avait emprunt? ? FTX 543 millions de dollars.

Des milliards de dollars sont partis en fum?e
La fine ?quipe des jeunes fanatiques de cryptomonnaies vivait dans une colocation de luxe ? Nassau, la capitale des Bahamas, d’une valeur estim?e ? 30 millions de dollars. Tout ?tait m?lang? dans ce monde : Sam Bankman-Fried, 30 ans, fils de professeurs de Stanford en Californie, avait pour petite amie Caroline Ellison, 28 ans, directrice g?n?rale du fonds sp?culatif Alameda. Aucune s?paration entre les activit?s n’?tait organis?e.

Cet empire champignon, qui fut valoris? 32 milliards de dollars il y a quelques mois dans son dernier tour de table avec des investisseurs, n’avait aucun contr?le interne s?rieux. Il s’est effondr? avec la chute du bitcoin et des cryptomonnaies, qui ont subi l’?clatement de la bulle boursi?re ? Wall Street.

La crise continue au P?rou malgr? les tentatives de d?samor?age de la nouvelle pr?sidente, Dina Boluarte, investie le 7 d?cembre apr?s la destitution de l’ex-chef de l’Etat Pedro Castillo. Les manifestations qui agitent le pays ont fait cinq nouveaux morts, lundi 12 d?cembre, portant ? sept le nombre de personnes tu?es en trente-six heures de troubles, selon une source au sein des services du m?diateur de la R?publique. Parmi ces sept victimes figurent trois adolescents de 15 et 16 ans.

Quatre personnes – deux ? Chincheros et deux ? Andahuaylas – ont ?t? tu?es lundi dans la r?gion d’Apurimac, lieu de naissance de Mme Boluarte, et deux autres manifestants sont encore mort dimanche. L’autre d?c?s de lundi est survenu ? Arequipa (Sud), la deuxi?me ville du P?rou, lorsque la police est intervenue pour chasser de l’a?roport des centaines de manifestants qui avaient install? des barricades en feu sur la piste.

Dimanche, Mme Boluarte – qui ?tait vice-pr?sidente jusqu’? son investiture –, avait tent? de faire baisser la pression en annon?ant qu’elle allait n?gocier « un accord (…) pour avancer les ?lections g?n?rales ? avril 2024 », apr?s la crise provoqu?e par la tentative rat?e de M. Castillo de dissoudre le Parlement. Elle a aussi d?clar? l’?tat d’urgence dans les zones les plus affect?es par les manifestations.

A Lima, les avocats de l’ancien pr?sident Pedro Castillo ont pu s’entretenir avec leur client dans sa prison en p?riph?rie est de Lima, avant l’audience en appel pr?vue mardi matin.

Haranguant les quelques partisans de Pedro Castillo pr?sents, il a assur? que le « pr?sident [n’?tait] pas bien » et qu’il avait demand? « l’intervention de la Croix-Rouge ». Toutefois, plusieurs proches de l’ex-chef de l’Etat se sont montr?s rassurants sur son ?tat de sant?.

Samedi, Mme Boluarte avait form? un gouvernement au profil ind?pendant et technique, avec un ancien procureur, Pedro Angulo, comme premier ministre. Mais cela n’avait pas apais? les tensions.

Dimanche ? Lima, entre mille et deux mille personnes avaient manifest? devant le Parlement aux cris de « Castillo tu n’es pas seul » avant d’?tre dispers?es. Lima a toujours tourn? le dos ? M. Castillo, un instituteur d’origine rurale, soutenu par les r?gions andines depuis les ?lections remport?es mi-2021.

Mercredi, le pr?sident de gauche de 53 ans avait ordonn? la dissolution du Parlement, quelques heures avant que celui-ci ne se r?unisse pour d?battre d’une proc?dure de destitution ? son encontre, la troisi?me depuis son accession au pouvoir en juillet 2021. Mais l’arm?e p?ruvienne, autrefois impliqu?e dans des coups d’Etat ou ayant soutenu des r?gimes autoritaires, n’a pas bronch?. Le Parlement a peu apr?s vot?, ? une large majorit?, sa destitution pour « incapacit? morale ».

Pedro Castillo a ?t? arr?t? quelques heures plus tard par son garde du corps alors qu’il se rendait ? l’ambassade du Mexique pour demander l’asile politique. Il est poursuivi par le parquet pour « r?bellion » et « conspiration ».

A peine entr?e en fonctions, la nouvelle maire de Los Angeles, Karen Bass, a annonc? vouloir s’attaquer imm?diatement ? l’?pineux probl?me des sans-abri qui touche la deuxi?me plus grande ville des Etats-Unis.

L’?lue d?mocrate a d?clar? l’?tat d’urgence, lundi 12 d?cembre, ? la suite de la mont?e en fl?che du nombre de homeless dans les rues de la cit? californienne, peupl?es de dizaines de milliers de personnes dormant dans des tentes ou dans des sacs de couchage, et suscitant la surprise des touristes qui viennent visiter l’une des zones urbaines les plus riches de la plan?te.

« Je ne tol?rerai pas une crise des sans-abri qui touche plus de 40 000 personnes et affecte chacun d’entre nous », a expliqu? Karen Bass, la premi?re femme ?lue maire de la ville, en novembre, et qui a pris ses fonctions dimanche en pr?tant serment en pr?sence de la vice-pr?sidente am?ricaine, Kamal Harris, ancienne procureure g?n?rale de Californie et amie de longue date.

« Changement radical »
« Ma mission est de mener Los Angeles vers une nouvelle direction avec une approche rapide et strat?gique pour r?soudre l’un des plus difficiles d?fis auxquels notre ville doit faire face », a-t-elle ajout?, expliquant que « le recours ? l’?tat d’urgence nous permet d’acc?l?rer les choses ».

L’?dile a promis un « changement radical » dans le mode op?ratoire, et d?clar? qu’elle signerait, dans les prochains jours, une s?rie de d?crets s’attaquant au probl?me, par exemple en fournissant des logements temporaires via la location par la ville d’appartements et de chambres d’h?tel. Elle a annonc? son intention de loger plus de 17 000 sans-abri au cours de la premi?re ann?e de son mandat.

Probl?mes de sant? mentale ou d’addiction
Ancienne ?lue ? la Chambre des repr?sentants et ancienne assistante m?dicale, Karen Bass, 69 ans, ?tait tr?s impliqu?e dans la vie associative de Los Angeles, ville dont elle est originaire. Elle a ?t? ?lue maire face au riche promoteur immobilier Rick Caruso, au terme d’une campagne domin?e par la question des sans-abri, devenue omnipr?sente dans le d?bat public local.

Les loyers parmi les plus chers du pays, le co?t de la vie ?lev? et des imp?ts bien sup?rieurs ? la moyenne nationale compliquent encore la situation. Le sujet est d’autant plus sensible que la population des sans-abri est aussi fortement concern?e par les probl?mes de sant? mentale ou d’addiction.

Los Angeles s’appr?tant ? accueillir les Jeux olympiques en 2028, nombre d’observateurs jugent que la municipalit? sera d’autant plus motiv?e ? faire dispara?tre les multiples tentes, parfois install?es ? seulement quelques m?tres de boutiques de luxes ou d’imposantes villas.";https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/12/13/la-nouvelle-maire-de-los-angeles-declare-l-etat-d-urgence-face-a-la-crise-des-sans-abri_6154102_3210.html

Lundi 5 d?cembre, Kostas Fragoulis, un jeune Rom de 16 ans, remplit le r?servoir de son v?hicule – qu’il conduit sans permis – pour 20 euros dans une station-service, pr?s du campement d’Agia Sofia, ? quelques kilom?tres de la ville de Thessalonique, dans le nord de la Gr?ce. Il part en trombe sans payer. S’ensuit une course-poursuite avec des policiers ? moto, alert?s par le pompiste. Dans un communiqu?, les forces de l’ordre affirment que « le conducteur effectuait des man?uvres dangereuses » et « tentait de percuter les motos des policiers ». L’un d’entre eux a tir? deux balles, dont l’une a touch? Kostas Fragoulis ? la t?te. Transport? ? l’h?pital, l’adolescent est rest? une semaine dans un ?tat critique. Mardi 13 d?cembre, l'h?pital a annonc? sa mort.

C’est une attaque « de sang-froid commise par la police. Kostas n’?tait pas arm? et n’a rien fait qui puisse justifier une telle r?action », avait d?nonc?, au moment des faits, l’avocat de la famille du jeune Rom, Th?ofilos Alexopoulos. Le policier de 34 ans qui a touch? l’adolescent ? la t?te a ?t? mis en disponibilit? et assign? ? r?sidence jusqu’? l’ouverture de son proc?s. Lundi 12 d?cembre, le procureur de Thessalonique a demand? sa mise en d?tention et son jugement pour « homicide » et « utilisation ill?gale » de son arme de fonction.

Le drame a tout de suite fait la une des m?dias en Gr?ce, car il n’est pas isol? dans un pays o? les violences polici?res se multiplient, particuli?rement contre les minorit?s. En octobre 2021, ? Perama, pr?s du port du Pir?e, un jeune Rom de 20 ans avait d?j? ?t? tu? par la police ? l’issue d’une course-poursuite. Les sept fonctionnaires impliqu?s font l’objet de poursuites pour meurtre et pour tentative de meurtre sur un autre jeune de 16 ans qui avait ?t? bless?, mais ils demeurent toujours en libert? conditionnelle dans l’attente de leur proc?s.

Le hashtag #RomaLivesMatter se r?pand
Ces derniers jours, les manifestations pour d?noncer les violences polici?res dont sont victimes les Roms se sont multipli?es ? travers la Gr?ce. Dans les cort?ges, des billets de 20 euros sont br?l?s et les repr?sentants de la communaut? rom crient : « Ce n’?tait pas une question d’essence ou d’argent, les flics lui ont tir? dessus parce qu’il ?tait rom. » Des vitrines de magasins et des v?hicules ont ?t? saccag?s dans le centre de Thessalonique, et une usine de pneus, pr?s d’un camp de Roms, dans la banlieue ath?nienne, a pris feu. Plusieurs raids de la police ont suivi pour essayer de ramener au calme les quelque 78 campements o? vivent les Roms dans toute la Gr?ce.

Les annonces de la Banque centrale du Nigeria (CBN) mardi 6 d?cembre, ont cr?? une onde de choc jusqu’au Parlement nig?rian, ? Abuja. Les ?lus s’interrogent sur la d?cision de limiter les retraits ? 20 000 nairas (quelque 42 euros) par jour et 100 000 nairas par semaine pour les particuliers, et 500 000 nairas (environ 1 068 euros) pour les entreprises. Avec l’entr?e en vigueur de cette nouvelle r?glementation le 9 janvier, tout retrait sup?rieur ? cette limite entra?nera des frais allant de 5 % ? 10 %.

Certains parlementaires critiquent une mesure « drastique », annonc?e « du jour au lendemain » et « sans consultations », mais qui pourrait avoir de lourdes cons?quences, « notamment pour les habitants des zones rurales o? toutes les transactions se font en cash ». Face ? cette lev?e de boucliers, le puissant gouverneur de la CBN a voulu jouer l’apaisement en indiquant que la limite pourrait ?ventuellement ?tre revue.

« Nous faisons cela pour le bien de l’?conomie et son d?veloppement », a d?clar? Godwin Emefiele, apr?s une rencontre avec le pr?sident Muhammadu Buhari, qui lui a apport? son soutien. « Nous n’allons pas ?tre trop rigides, mais ?a ne veut pas dire que nous allons abandonner », a-t-il pr?cis?.

Depuis 2011, l’institut d’?mission cherche ? moderniser les syst?mes de paiement, en incitant la population ? privil?gier les usages ?lectroniques, qu’il s’agisse de transferts d’argent par mobile ou de paiements par carte bancaire. D?sormais, l’objectif est aussi d’encourager l’adoption du eNaira – la monnaie num?rique lanc?e il y a un peu plus d’un an. Gr?ce ? ces outils, la CBN compte atteindre 95 % d’int?gration financi?re d’ici ? 2024, alors que fin 2021 seuls 64 % des adultes avaient acc?s au syst?me bancaire dans le pays le plus peupl? d’Afrique (220 millions d’habitants).

Des « mini-banques » chez des commer?ants
« L’id?e est de diffuser ces outils dans les r?gions qui sont actuellement les plus isol?es, commente Olaolu Boboye, ?conomiste pour CardinalStone ? Lagos. Un Nig?rian moyen poss?de au moins un t?l?phone portable basique, avec lequel il peut transf?rer de petites sommes gr?ce ? un code USSD. Le eNaira a aussi montr? des r?sultats encourageants, m?me s’ils sont en dessous des attentes initiales. Plus g?n?ralement, cette mesure va ouvrir des opportunit?s suppl?mentaires pour la Fintech. »

M. Boboye raconte que, lorsqu’il ?tait ?tudiant, il devait parcourir des kilom?tres pour retirer de l’argent dans la ville voisine. D?sormais install? ? Lagos, il dit ne pas avoir utilis? un distributeur automatique de billets depuis deux ans. « Cela me co?terait environ 200 nairas pour me rendre jusqu’? celui qui se trouve le plus pr?s de mon domicile, justifie-t-il. Et, souvent, il y a de longues files d’attente ou alors il n’y a pas de billets dans les machines. » A la place, Olaolu Boboye retire dans un « point de vente » (Point of Sale, POS), c’est-?-dire aupr?s d’un commer?ant poss?dant un terminal bancaire.

Cal? dans sa minuscule ?choppe remplie de sacs de pain et de sachets de lait en poudre, Nuhu glisse des billets froiss?s au client qui lui a fait un transfert d’argent la veille. « Je suis venu r?cup?rer 27 000 nairas, raconte ce dernier. ?a me prendrait beaucoup trop de temps d’aller ? la banque. C’est beaucoup plus pratique de venir ici. La commission de 200 nairas que je dois payer pour utiliser ce POS ne me d?range pas. »

Ces « mini-banques » ont pouss? ? tous les coins de rue ces dix derni?res ann?es, cr?ant une source de revenus pour des milliers de familles. Mais les directives de la Banque centrale risquent bien de mettre un terme ? cette activit?. « Si je ne peux retirer que 20 000 nairas par jour, je serai oblig? d’arr?ter », confirme Nuhu.

Une situation confuse et impr?visible
Ce nouveau plafond de retrait risque d’affecter tout particuli?rement les petits commerces, au c?ur de l’?conomie nig?riane. « Le r?seau mobile est trop mauvais. Les alertes indiquant un transfert d’argent peuvent parfois mettre deux heures ? arriver, l?che Jordan, un autre client de Nuhu. Personne n’a de temps ? perdre pour ?a ! » Ces annonces pourraient aussi « miner la confiance en un syst?me bancaire jug? obsol?te et pousser les gens ? retirer un maximum d’argent pour faire des r?serves », selon Tunde Ajileye, analyste pour SBM intelligence, qui met aussi en garde contre « un possible d?placement de la demande vers le march? noir ».

La situation est d’autant plus confuse et impr?visible que la Banque centrale a ?galement annonc? fin octobre que les billets actuellement en circulation vont ?tre remplac?s. Les Nig?rians ont jusqu’au 31 janvier pour ramener leurs liquidit?s en banque et obtenir de nouveaux billets, avant que les anciens ne deviennent obsol?tes. Cette annonce a provoqu? une ru?e vers le dollar et la chute vertigineuse du naira sur le march? parall?le des changes dans les jours qui ont suivi.

Officiellement, il s’agit de reprendre le contr?le des liquidit?s, alors que 80 % des devises en circulation se trouveraient en dehors des banques, selon les statistiques officielles. La Banque centrale esp?re ainsi mieux ma?triser l’inflation, mettre un frein au blanchiment et ? la contrefa?on, et… limiter les achats de vote, ? la veille de l’?lection pr?sidentielle du 25 f?vrier 2023.

Sauf que « le timing et la pr?cipitation » de ces annonces peuvent « poser question », selon Tunde Adjileye. Peut-?tre la CBN tente-t-elle de « limiter la demande pour ?viter d’avoir des probl?mes d’approvisionnement » en nouveaux billets de banque ? D’autant que l’impression de ces nouvelles coupures co?te tr?s cher. De son c?t?, le gouverneur Godwin Emefiele assure que les banques ont d?j? re?u les nouveaux billets et qu’elles sont pr?tes ? commencer leur distribution.";https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2022/12/12/le-nigeria-fait-un-pas-supplementaire-vers-une-economie-sans-cash_6154091_3212.html

Tribune. L’hommage, que la Fondation de la Maison de Tunisie ? Paris, en collaboration avec le Comit? pour le respect des libert?s et des droits de l’homme en Tunisie (CRLDHT), avait initialement pr?vu de rendre le 9 d?cembre 2022 ? Sophie Bessis, historienne et intellectuelle tunisienne engag?e, internationalement reconnue tant pour ses ouvrages que pour ses prises de position, vient d’?tre « report? » sine die par cette institution au motif de « contraintes d’ordre administratif et logistique ». Tels sont les termes laconiques d’un message envoy? quelques jours avant l’?v?nement par les responsables de la Maison de Tunisie.

Comment ne pas rapprocher une telle d?cision ex abrupto du climat d’hostilit? entretenu ? l’heure actuelle ? l’?gard des d?mocrates de notre pays ? Cette d?cision semble en effet confirmer une inqui?tante d?rive vers l’interdiction de toute parole libre et critique ? l’?gard du pouvoir.

Lire aussi : En Tunisie, le pr?sident Ka?s Sa?ed instaure une nouvelle loi ?lectorale marginalisant les partis politiques
Sophie Bessis, femme de gauche et militante f?ministe qui s’exprime r?guli?rement pour la d?fense des droits et libert?s et dont l’engagement d?mocratique n’est plus ? d?montrer, doit pouvoir s’exprimer librement au sein des institutions publiques tunisiennes.

Si la soir?e pr?vue le 9 d?cembre 2022 devait avant tout rendre hommage ? son ?uvre et ? son parcours, et non traiter sp?cialement de l’actualit? tunisienne, les points de vue critiques r?cemment formul?s par l’historienne contre l’?volution anti-d?mocratique du pouvoir tunisien nous semblent clairement constituer la toile de fond de l’annulation de l’?v?nement. Tout comme la pr?sence de participants qui n’ont cess? de d?noncer ces derniers mois la d?rive des institutions tunisiennes vers une pr?sidence omnipotente.

La censure dont Sophie Bessis n’est pas la seule ? faire aujourd’hui l’objet est une manifestation suppl?mentaire et alarmante de la volont? des autorit?s de r?duire au silence la soci?t? civile, les intellectuels et toutes les institutions ind?pendantes qui s’opposent au retour de pratiques que l’on croyait appartenir au pass?.

C’est la raison pour laquelle nous exprimons notre solidarit? avec Sophie Bessis en d?non?ant cette atteinte inacceptable ? la libert? d’expression et en exprimant notre inqui?tude devant la volont? de plus en plus claire du pouvoir de censurer les intellectuels qui veulent continuer ? s’exprimer librement.

Voil? un mois, l’arm?e russe quittait la ville de Kherson, l’unique grande cit? du sud de l’Ukraine conquise depuis son invasion, fin f?vrier. Le pr?sident ukrainien, Volodymyr Zelensky, parlait alors du « d?but de la fin de la guerre ». Pourtant, les soldats de Moscou ne sont pas partis loin. Ils ont juste chang? de rive, de l’autre c?t? du Dniepr, le grand fleuve qui borde Kherson.

Du pont Antonivsky, seul point de passage entre les deux berges avant d’?tre d?truit lors du repli, on peut les apercevoir ? la jumelle ? 400 m?tres. Du grand escalier du parc Slavy qui descend vers les eaux du Dniepr, on ne voit pas ?me qui vive sur les ?les qui s?parent les deux rives. Du port de Kherson o? un navire est ? moiti? coul?, on ne distingue, de l’autre c?t?, qu’une grue et quelques maisons inhabit?es. Mais le bruit de d?tonations rappelle que les Russes sont bien l?.

Depuis le retrait des Russes de l’autre c?t? du fleuve, les autorit?s militaires ukrainiennes s’interrogent sur la strat?gie ? suivre. Traverser le Dniepr n’est pas une mince affaire. Depuis la destruction du pont Antonivsky, le passage le plus proche se trouve ? 70 kilom?tres ? l’est.

Casse-t?te strat?gique
Au niveau de Kherson, le fleuve devient estuaire et d?bouche sur la mer Noire toute proche. Sur plusieurs kilom?tres de large, il se divise en bras secondaires, de vraies rivi?res qui serpentent entre des langues de terre parsem?es de v?g?tation, de maisons de campagne et de petits lacs. Un casse-t?te strat?gique et une barri?re naturelle difficile ? franchir quand il faut faire passer des hommes et des v?hicules lourds.

Sur leur rive, les soldats ukrainiens restent d’ailleurs ? couvert par crainte des snipers et des bombardements. Le 4 d?cembre, rue Druzhby, qui longe le parc Slavy, le flanc d’un b?timent a ?t? souffl? par un missile, sans faire de victime. A 100 m?tres de l?, toutes les vitres de la biblioth?que universitaire, qui surplombe le Dniepr, ont ?t? souffl?es par les explosions. Les habitants prennent la pr?caution de contourner le parc pour ne pas ?tre la cible de tireurs embusqu?s, comme ils fuient les abords du pont Antonivsky. Kherson craint les missiles, l’artillerie, les mortiers, mais aussi de simples fusils.

Le 5 d?cembre, dans un b?timent du port, un membre de l’administration r?gionale vient attendre trois petits bateaux ? moteur venant de l’autre rive. A leur bord, dix personnes qui s’?taient repli?es dans l’une des tr?s nombreuses maisons d’?t? et de week-end situ?es sur les ?les s?parant les deux berges, pour ?viter de croiser les Russes pendant l’occupation ou rester ? l’?cart de la guerre. D?sormais, sur la ligne de front, elles sont prises au pi?ge.

L’?re de l’argent gratuit est r?volue, et les premi?res victimes apparaissent. En Allemagne, le rachat du livreur Gorillas par son concurrent turc Getir, annonc? vendredi 9 d?cembre, est un signe d?cisif d’une d?crue des investissements et d’une acc?l?ration de la concentration dans le secteur de la livraison rapide de courses, ou quick-commerce, qui n’a encore jamais fait la preuve de sa rentabilit?.

La valeur de Gorillas est d?sormais estim?e par les milieux financiers ? 1,2 milliard de dollars (1,33 milliard d’euros), le nouvel ensemble Getir ? 10 milliards de dollars. Pour les deux entreprises, c’est une grosse d?cote par rapport ? leur derni?re lev?e de fonds.

Gorillas est embl?matique de l’?closion d’une activit? au mod?le ?conomique d?ficitaire, dont les acteurs sont maintenus sur le march? uniquement gr?ce aux injections des fonds de capital-risque. L’entreprise berlinoise, fond?e d?but 2020, a pris son envol ? la faveur des confinements li?s ? la pand?mie de Covid-19.

Croissance agressive
Son principe : livrer des produits de consommation courante, en dix minutes, gr?ce ? des coursiers ? bicyclette ?quip?s d’un sac ? dos. Une strat?gie de croissance agressive a permis ? Gorillas de conqu?rir en quelques mois les rues les plus prometteuses des m?tropoles allemandes et europ?ennes, mais aussi de Londres et de New York.

Au point de faire na?tre une fi?vre d’investissement chez les investisseurs. En 2021, moins de deux ans apr?s son lancement, Gorillas acqu?rait le statut de « licorne », titre autrefois rare des entreprises valoris?es ? plus de 1 milliard de dollars. Au printemps 2022, elle avait m?me rachet? son concurrent fran?ais Frichti.

C’est une des premi?res licornes ? subir le retournement de conjoncture li? ? la remont?e des taux d’int?r?t

Cette croissance a pris fin aussi vite qu’elle a commenc?. Pionnier europ?en, Gorillas a ?galement ?t? tr?s t?t confront? aux contradictions de la livraison ultrarapide : la start-up, sp?cialis?e dans une activit? aux marges d?j? faibles, br?lait, chaque mois, plusieurs millions d’euros de capital pour maintenir sa position. Celle qui se pr?sentait comme une « communaut? » tentait de limiter les pertes en ?conomisant sur les co?ts de personnel… et a d? tr?s t?t faire face ? des mouvements sociaux d’ampleur parmi ses livreurs, qui se plaignaient des conditions de travail.

D?pendant des lev?es de fonds devenues al?atoires, l’?toile Gorillas a d?finitivement perdu sa brillance avec l’arriv?e de la crise. C’est une des premi?res licornes ? subir le retournement de conjoncture li? ? la remont?e des taux d’int?r?t, ? l’augmentation des prix alimentaires, des co?ts de logistique et ? la rar?faction du personnel.

A Melitopol, explosion d’un pont strat?gique utilis? par l’arm?e russe
Un pont utilis? par l’arm?e russe a explos? pr?s de Melitopol, a rapport? le maire de cette ville occup?e par les Russes dans l’oblast de Zaporijia, dans le sud-est de l’Ukraine.

« C’est l’un des ponts strat?giquement importants, comme le pont de Crim?e », a ainsi expliqu? Ivan Fedorov, ajoutant que les forces russes s’en servaient pour livrer du mat?riel vers l’est.

Le pont de Crim?e, qui sert ?galement d’approvisionnement logistique russe pour la Crim?e et le sud de l’Ukraine, avait subi une explosion le 8 octobre. Moscou a accus? Kiev d’?tre derri?re cette attaque.

Selon le site d’informations ukrainien Kyiv independent, l’?tat-major g?n?ral des forces arm?es ukrainiennes a signal? dimanche que les forces russes de Melitopol for?aient les r?sidents ? obtenir des passeports russes et ? passer de la monnaie ukrainienne au rouble russe. Selon le rapport, les forces russes tenteraient ?galement d’encourager les habitants ? collaborer en augmentant l’aide aux retrait?s et en augmentant les salaires de ceux qui acceptent de travailler dans des institutions ?tablies en Russie.

JO de Paris 2024 : les Etats-Unis favorables au retour des athl?tes russes et bi?lorusses sous banni?re neutre
Le comit? olympique et paralympique am?ricain (USOPC) s’est dit favorable ? la r?int?gration sous banni?re neutre, pour les JO de Paris en 2024, des athl?tes russes et bi?lorusses. Ces derniers sont exclus des comp?titions internationales ? la suite de l’invasion russe en Ukraine.

Il y avait un « int?r?t unanime » parmi les d?l?gu?s d’un r?cent sommet du Comit? international olympique (CIO) ? trouver une voie vers le retour ? la comp?tition de ces athl?tes, ont d?clar? les responsables am?ricains.

« Il y a une r?elle volont? que cela arrive car notre mission est de rassembler pacifiquement le monde autour du sport », a expliqu? la pr?sidente de l’USOPC, Susanne Lyons, ? des journalistes. « Le mouvement olympique peut difficilement tol?rer que ces athl?tes soient interdits de concourir », a-t-elle dit.

La « neutralit? » des athl?tes russes et bi?lorusses ?viterait les risques de boycottage comme dans les ann?es 1970 et 1980, estime Mme Lyons.

Il y a des conflits autour du monde tous les jours, des pays en guerre tous les jours, et si les gens d?cident de boycotter des choses en rendant coup pour coup – “Vous n’?tes pas venus ? nos JO, nous n’irons pas aux v?tres” – l’essence du mouvement olympique et paralympique va rapidement dispara?tre.

La neutralit? doit ?tre « stricte » et « il ne peut y avoir de couleurs ou de nom du pays », a-t-elle soulign?. Lors des Jeux d’hiver de P?kin en f?vrier cette ann?e, les athl?tes russes n’avaient pu concourir que sous les couleurs de leur comit? olympique pour cause de sanctions apr?s des scandales de dopage mais beaucoup avaient quand m?me rev?tu des combinaisons aux couleurs russes.

La r?int?gration des sportifs russes et bi?lorusses dans les comp?titions en Asie, premi?re ?tape avant une r?int?gration internationale, a ?t? ?voqu?e lors du « Sommet olympique » de Lausanne le 9 d?cembre qui rassemblait notamment des d?l?gations am?ricaine, chinoise et russe, mais pas de repr?sentant ukrainien.

Les responsables olympiques veulent ?galement se pencher sur l’id?e de conditionner le retour des athl?tes ? leurs assurances qu’ils n’ont jamais soutenu la Russie dans le conflit ukrainien, m?me si Mme Lyons a reconnu qu’il pourrait ?tre « impossible » de le faire. « Mais il existe un accord sur [un retour] des athl?tes qui n’ont pas activement soutenu » Moscou, a-t-elle point?.

Un compromis avec la Hongrie permet le d?blocage d’une aide europ?enne ? l’Ukraine
Un compromis a ?t? trouv? au sein de l’Union europ?enne (UE) avec la Hongrie, ce lundi soir, ce qui permet de lever les r?serves de Budapest sur l’octroi d’une aide ? l’Ukraine en 2023.

« Les ambassadeurs de l’UE ont approuv? le principe d’une aide de 18 milliards d’euros ? l’Ukraine, d’un imp?t minimum de 15 % pour les grandes entreprises, de l’approbation du Plan de relance (PRRF) de la Hongrie et d’un accord sur la conditionnalit? », a affirm? la pr?sidence tch?que du Conseil de l’UE sur son compte twitter. « Le paquet sera confirm? par proc?dure ?crite », a-t-elle pr?cis?. Elle sera lanc?e mercredi, a-t-on pr?cis? de source diplomatique

Le premier ministre hongrois Viktor Orban refusait de donner l’accord de la Hongrie ? l’octroi de cette aide financi?re ? l’Ukraine si son plan de relance et les fonds de coh?sion pr?vus pour son pays ?taient bloqu?s par ses partenaires. Budapest refusait ?galement son accord ? un imp?t minimum de 15 % pour les grandes entreprises.

L’accord trouv? ce soir est un d?saveu pour la Commission europ?enne. L’ex?cutif bruxellois pr?sid? par l’Allemande Ursula von der Leyen recommandait de geler 7,5 milliards de fonds europ?ens destin?s ? la Hongrie, estimant que les derni?res r?formes adopt?es par Budapest pour lutter contre la corruption n’?taient toujours pas suffisantes. Le d?boursement des 5,8 milliards du plan de relance ?conomique pr?sent? par Budapest ?tait ?galement suspendu ? la r?alisation de r?formes en mati?re d’?tat de droit.

Les Etats membres ont pris en compte les derni?res mesures adopt?es mercredi par le Parlement hongrois pour att?nuer la conditionnalit? impos?e ? la Hongrie. Le compromis de ce lundi soir r?duit ? 6,3 milliards les fonds europ?ens gel?s pour pousser Budapest ? se conformer aux mesures demand?es par ses partenaires, a fait savoir une source diplomatique.

Selon Washington, les stocks de munitions russes se sont amenuis?s
La Russie semble ?tre contrainte d’utiliser des bombes p?rim?es, ses stocks de munitions s’amenuisant apr?s plus de neuf mois de guerre en Ukraine, a expliqu? aujourd’hui un haut responsable militaire am?ricain.

Les stocks de munitions modernes de Moscou risquent de ne durer que jusqu’? d?but 2023 si les forces russes continuent de bombarder l’Ukraine au rythme actuel, a d?clar? ce responsable ayant requis l’anonymat. C’est « probablement ce qui les force ? utiliser des bombes que nous consid?rerions comme p?rim?es », a-t-il ajout?. « En d’autres termes, on charge la bombe et on croise les doigts en esp?rant qu’elle va partir, ou qu’elle va exploser ? l’atterrissage. »

Le ministre am?ricain de la d?fense a ?voqu? le mois dernier les probl?mes de stocks de munitions des forces russes, qu’il a attribu?s aux probl?mes logistiques de Moscou et aux frappes des forces ukrainiennes contre des d?p?ts de munitions russes.

A la veille d’une conf?rence sur l’aide d’urgence ? apporter ? l’Ukraine, Jens Stoltenberg, le secr?taire g?n?ral de l’Alliance atlantique, revient, dans un entretien au Parisien, sur le r?le jou? par l’OTAN depuis l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie.

Il estime que « la probabilit? que la Russie emploie une arme nucl?aire en Ukraine est faible ». Il prend soin d’ajouter que « les d?g?ts potentiels seraient ?normes, donc il faut prendre au s?rieux cette menace. Tout recours ? ces armes en Ukraine changerait radicalement la nature de la guerre et aurait des cons?quences graves pour la Russie. On ne peut pas gagner une guerre nucl?aire ».

Selon M. Stoltenberg, Vladimir Poutine est conscient des risques pour la Russie en cas d’attaque. Il accuse le pr?sident russe d’?tre « responsable d’une brutalit? telle que nous n’en avons pas vu depuis la deuxi?me guerre mondiale ».

Selon lui, Vladimir Poutine a « sous-estim? la force du peuple ukrainien, de ses forces arm?es et de ses leaders. Et il a sous-estim? l’unit? et la force des partenaires de l’OTAN dans leur soutien sans pr?c?dent ? l’Ukraine. Nous le ferons aussi longtemps qu’il le faudra ».

M. Stoltenberg assure que les alli?s occidentaux continueront ? livrer des armes ? l’Ukraine parce que « c’est n?cessaire. Une victoire de Poutine serait une trag?die pour les Ukrainiens, mais ce serait aussi dangereux pour nous. Car cela signifierait que, si des dirigeants autoritaires violent les lois et usent de la force militaire, ils peuvent atteindre leurs objectifs. Cela nous rendrait plus vuln?rables dans un monde plus dangereux ». Il rappelle que pour continuer ? soutenir l’Ukraine, « il va falloir aussi intensifier la production, tant aux ?tats-Unis qu’en Europe ».

Interrog? sur l’issue du conflit, sa dur?e, le secr?taire g?n?ral conclut que, « si nous voulons une paix durable, garantissant que l’Ukraine reste un pays souverain et ind?pendant, le meilleur moyen est de poursuivre notre soutien ? l’Ukraine pour convaincre [Vladimir] Poutine qu’il doit s’asseoir ? la table de discussions ». Il ajoute : « Ce sont les Ukrainiens qui devront d?cider du moment et des conditions pour cette n?gociation. »

Volodymyr Zelensky demande au G7 de fournir davantage d’armes ? l’Ukraine
Apr?s pr?s de neuf mois d’invasion russe de son pays, le pr?sident ukrainien, Volodymyr Zelensky, a exhort? aujourd’hui les pays du G7 ? fournir plus d’armes et d’?quipements militaires ? l’Ukraine. « L’Ukraine a besoin de chars modernes », « de l’artillerie, des canons et des obus », ainsi que « des missiles ? longue port?e », a list? M. Zelensky au G7 r?uni en visioconf?rence, selon des propos rapport?s par la pr?sidence ukrainienne.

L’Ukraine a besoin d’« environ deux milliards de m?tres cubes » de gaz suppl?mentaires pour passer l’hiver, a continu? M. Zelensky. « La terreur contre nos centrales ?lectriques nous a amen?s ? utiliser plus de gaz que pr?vu. Et c’est pourquoi nous avons besoin d’un soutien suppl?mentaire, cet hiver. Nous parlons d’un volume d’environ deux milliards de m?tres cubes de gaz qui doit ?tre achet? en plus. »

Il a propos? aux pays du G7 un « sommet de la paix mondiale » sur l’Ukraine. « Je propose de convoquer un sommet sp?cial – le sommet sur la paix mondiale – pour d?cider comment et quand nous pouvons mettre en ?uvre les points de la formule de paix ukrainienne », a-t-il annonc?, appelant la Russie ? « retirer ses troupes d’Ukraine » avant No?l pour « assurer une cessation durable des hostilit?s ».

Des centaines de milliers d’Ukrainiens pourraient affluer vers l’Europe au cours des prochains mois
Jan Egeland, le secr?taire g?n?ral du Conseil norv?gien pour les r?fugi?s (NRC) s’attend ? une nouvelle arriv?e massive de r?fugi?s ukrainiens en Europe. Il explique ? l’agence Reuters que des centaines de milliers de personnes vont se d?placer, en raison des attaques russes contre l’infrastructure ?lectrique de l’Ukraine. Moscou affirme que ses frappes ne visent pas les civils mais visent ? r?duire la capacit? de l’Ukraine ? se battre et ? la pousser ? n?gocier.

« Je crains que la crise humanitaire en Europe ne s’aggrave et que cela n’?clipse ?galement les crises dans d’autres endroits du monde », a-t-il expliqu? ? Reuters. Environ 18 millions de personnes, soit 40 % de la population ukrainienne, d?pendent de l’aide, selon les Nations unies. 7,8 millions d’autres ont quitt? le pays pour d’autres parties de l’Europe.

Un volontaire fran?ais bless? en Ukraine attend d’?tre rapatri? pour ?tre soign? en France
Maxime Bronchain, 32 ans, avait d?cid? de partir en Ukraine en mai, « pour r?pondre ? l’appel du pr?sident [Volodymyr] Zelensky », qui, d?s l’invasion russe de son pays fin f?vrier, avait ouvertement invit? des ?trangers ? rejoindre une « l?gion internationale » pour d?fendre l’Ukraine. Ce Fran?ais parti combattre aux c?t?s des soldats ukrainiens contre la Russie a saut? sur une mine fin novembre dans le Donbass et attend d?sormais son rapatriement, organis? par le Quai d’Orsay, a appris l’Agence France-Presse aupr?s de l’int?ress? et du minist?re des affaires ?trang?res.

« J’ai ?t? bless? le 27 novembre dans une for?t, alors que notre bataillon commen?ait ? entrer dans [l’oblast] de Louhansk, au nord-est de Svatove », dans l’est de l’Ukraine, o? les combats font rage contre les forces russes, a dit ? l’AFP par t?l?phone Maxime Bronchain actuellement pris en charge dans un h?pital militaire de la capitale. « J’ai saut? sur une mine, je suis gravement bless? au pied gauche. Un Am?ricain qui ?tait avec moi a saut? sur une mine puis une deuxi?me en venant m’aider. Il est mort pendant son ?vacuation », d?taille le Fran?ais, qui faisait partie d’une unit? de reconnaissance d’une vingtaine de combattants ?trangers, « dont cinq Fran?ais », au sein de la l?gion internationale.

Il a subi cinq op?rations depuis sa blessure et a refus? l’amputation, mais craint d?sormais de perdre son pied. En contact avec l’ambassade de France en Ukraine, il attend aujourd’hui d’?tre rapatri? vers la France. « Il y a de forts risques infectieux, et les Ukrainiens sont en p?nurie de morphine », s’inqui?te son fr?re Florent, contact? par l’AFP.

« L’ambassade de France en Ukraine, en lien avec le centre de crise et de soutien, apporte l’assistance n?cessaire ? notre compatriote, comme nous le faisons pour tous les Fran?ais en difficult? ? l’?tranger » a comment? lundi le minist?re fran?ais des affaires ?trang?res, en assurant que, « compte tenu de sa situation, notre compatriote sera transport? en dehors d’Ukraine en vue d’une ?vacuation vers la France ».

Le Quai d’Orsay « souhaite rappeler ? cette occasion les risques li?s ? un d?placement en Ukraine, qui est class?e en zone rouge. Tout d?placement quelle qu’en soit la nature est formellement d?conseill? », ajoute-t-il dans un message adress? ? l’AFP.

Employ? dans la restauration dans l’est de la France, Maxime Bronchain a ?t? militaire pendant un an au sein de l’arm?e de terre fran?aise quand il avait 18 ans, « j’avais envie d’?tre utile », t?moigne-t-il. « Ici les gens nous accueillent en lib?rateurs, ils nous prennent dans leurs bras. » P?re d’un enfant rest? en France, Maxime a l’intention d’?pouser une Ukrainienne originaire d’Odessa, rencontr?e dans le pays en guerre.

« Elles ont fait un point sur l’op?ration Cigogne, qui a permis l’accueil d’enfants ukrainiens souffrant d’un cancer en France, et sur les 20 000 enfants scolaris?s en France » depuis le d?but de l’intervention russe, le 24 f?vrier, a-t-on pr?cis? dans l’entourage de Mme Macron. Elles se rendront mardi dans une ?cole du 3e arrondissement de Paris qui accueille des enfants de familles ayant fui la guerre, selon cette source.

« Elles ont aussi ?chang? au sujet de la fondation que Mme Zelenska a lanc?e » pour recueillir de l’aide humanitaire et permettre la reconstruction d’h?pitaux dans l’est de l’Ukraine, a-t-on pr?cis?. Les ?pouses des pr?sidents se connaissent bien, a soulign? un conseiller de Brigitte Macron, rappelant que Volodymyr Zelensky avait effectu? en France, en juin 2019, un de ses tout premiers voyages ? l’?tranger apr?s son ?lection et que les deux femmes se sont r?guli?rement revues depuis.

Elles se sont appel?es au d?but de la pand?mie de Covid-19, ont ?chang? par ?crit ou en visioconf?rence depuis le 24 f?vrier et se sont revues ? New York en septembre, en marge de l’Assembl?e g?n?rale des Nations unies.

« L’objectif est de construire rapidement cette plate-forme avec la participation de l’Ukraine, des institutions financi?res internationales et d’autres partenaires », a-t-il expliqu?, lors d’une conf?rence de presse ? Berlin. Il a compar? la reconstruction de l’Ukraine au plan Marshall mis en place par les Etats-Unis pour reconstruire l’Europe apr?s la seconde guerre mondiale.

Une nouvelle conf?rence de soutien ? l’Ukraine, ? propos de l’aide d’urgence et de la reconstruction du pays ? long terme, se tiendra mardi ? Paris. « Nous sommes convaincus que c’est notre unit?, notre d?termination, qui ont isol? le pr?sident russe, et nous demandons ? nouveau ?

Ces sommets ont lieu alors que les forces russes visent les infrastructures des services publics essentiels, provoquant notamment des coupures d’?lectricit? affectant des millions de personnes en plein hiver.

Bonjour,
Vous n'avez pas ?voqu? la destruction du QG Wagner par l'arm?e ukrainienne la nuit derni?re.
Pourquoi ce retard dans l'information? Cette nouvelle ne m?rite-t-elle pas plus d'attention que les v?ux de fin d'ann?e de Poutine ?
Snake
Bonjour Snake,

Nous avons ?voqu? cette frappe hier. Serhi Ha?da?, le gouverneur de l’oblast de Louhansk, a affirm? que l’arm?e ukrainienne a frapp? un quartier g?n?ral utilis? par le groupe paramilitaire Wagner dans les territoires occup?s de la r?gion de Louhansk. Il a expliqu? ? la t?l?vision ukrainienne qu’une frappe dans la ville de Kadiivka avait entra?n? un « nombre ?norme » de morts dans les rangs du groupe de mercenaires. Il est difficile de v?rifier de mani?re ind?pendante qu’un QG du groupe Wagner se trouvait sur le site de l’attaque ou que cette frappe a fait un grand nombre de victimes.

Mais un certain nombre d’?l?ments semblent confirmer que c’est bien le groupe de mercenaires qui a ?t? touch?. L’agence Tass a confirm? qu’un h?tel de la ville de Kadiivka, que les Russes appellent Stakhanov, a ?t? touch? par des tirs de Himars dimanche.

Des photographies et des vid?os publi?es sur les r?seaux sociaux montrent l’h?tel situ? dans la ville avant et apr?s la frappe.

n Ukraine, les gens ont froid. Alors que l’hiver rugueux est d?j? bien pr?sent, il n’y a plus de chauffage, plus de lumi?re, plus d’eau courante pendant plusieurs heures par jour. Les missiles russes sur les villes et les infrastructures ?lectriques visent les civils. C’est une v?ritable torture lente, physique et psychologique, qui est inflig?e ? l’ensemble de la population.

Cette brutalit? criminelle s’ajoute ? celle qui se d?ploie avec permissivit? depuis le d?but de l’agression russe : les femmes viol?es, les enfants enlev?s sous couvert de « placement en famille » en Russie, les massacres d’innocents jet?s dans des fosses communes. Ce sont bien des crimes de masse qui se d?roulent tous les jours sur le sol europ?en.

Pour faire face, l’aide envoy?e en Ukraine atteint des sommets. Pourtant, peu de soutien arrive aux gens sur place et leur situation s’aggrave. Pourquoi ? Comment faire pour les aider au mieux ?

Manque de savoir-faire
L’?crasante majorit? de l’aide est envoy?e aux grandes ONG et aux organisations internationales. Pour les bailleurs de fonds institutionnels comme pour les individus qui donnent, cela repr?sente en effet une garantie de s?rieux, une assurance que l’argent ne sera pas d?tourn? par la corruption, et une occasion de communiquer avec plus de facilit?.

Lire aussi : Le d?fi de l’aide civile internationale ? l’Ukraine
Or ces organisations ne sont pas habitu?es ? travailler « avec » les institutions et les associations locales en temps de guerre, alors que, en Ukraine, le syst?me est robuste : l’Etat central continue de fonctionner, dans une articulation fine avec les collectivit?s locales et les organisations de la soci?t? civile.

Les approches, habitudes, repr?sentations et cultures des grandes ONG et des organisations internationales les poussent ? intervenir en se substituant ? un Etat souvent fortement affaibli, quand il ne s’est pas effondr? avec la guerre. Ces m?mes raisons les poussent, par ailleurs, ? peu renforcer les capacit?s des pays dans lesquels elles interviennent, cr?ant ainsi une d?pendance et des situations de grande fragilit? quand elles partent.

Dans la configuration ukrainienne, elles ne savent pas vraiment faire. De plus, leur vitesse d’apprentissage est lente. Par cons?quent, elles agissent souvent ? c?t? des besoins r?els, le g?chis d’argent est massif, et la population ukrainienne souffre.

Configuration in?dite
A l’inverse, depuis f?vrier, les acteurs locaux d’Ukraine et d’ailleurs en Europe organisent la solidarit? de mani?re efficace. C’est un champ d’action nouveau pour eux. En effet, s’il existe classiquement une coop?ration internationale locale en temps de paix, elle est quasiment inexistante pendant une guerre, notamment quand elle concerne des populations d?plac?es.

Nous sommes le 12 octobre, dans la salle des f?tes de l’Elys?e. Emmanuel Macron vient de remettre les insignes de commandeur de la L?gion d’honneur ? son ancien ma?tre ? penser, Jean-Pierre Chev?nement, seule personnalit? politique que le jeune pr?sident a suivie dans un parti, ? la fin des ann?es 1990, celui pour lequel il vota le 21 avril 2002. Une figure qui a marqu? cinquante ans de vie politique nationale, l’un des chefs de file de la vieille gauche antiatlantiste, mais aussi russophile convaincu, d?cor?, en 2017, de l’ordre de l’Amiti? par Vladimir Poutine, au titre de « repr?sentant sp?cial » de la France pour la Russie.

Lire aussi (2014) : Article r?serv? ? nos abonn?s A Moscou, Chev?nement et « la m?canique de la b?tise »
Ce jour-l?, donc, devant une assembl?e de politiques et d’ambassadeurs, Emmanuel Macron exhume diverses anecdotes sur son passage au Mouvement des citoyens. Il exalte aussi cet esprit libre qui, de « Belfort ? Moscou », a port? au plus haut les valeurs de la R?publique et assure que ceux pour qui Chev?nement « aime un peu trop la Russie (…) m?connaissent [les] m?andres » de l’homme. Au-del? de l’hommage personnel, cette matrice chev?nementiste serait-elle l’une des cl?s pour comprendre la d?routante diplomatie d’Emmanuel Macron depuis le d?but du conflit engag? par la Russie en Ukraine, il y a bient?t dix mois ?

Son « en m?me temps » diplomatique est un myst?re. Il trouble les diplomates du Quai d’Orsay et d?concerte ses partenaires europ?ens et am?ricains. La guerre est de retour en Europe, et l’obstination du pr?sident fran?ais ? parler aussi bien ? son homologue ukrainien, Volodymyr Zelensky, qu’? Vladimir Poutine braque une partie des capitales du continent, notamment Varsovie, Tallin, Riga, Vilnius, Helsinki et Stockholm. A intervalles r?guliers, Emmanuel Macron met ? mal les relations ?troites construites avec M. Zelensky, donnant des sueurs froides aux diplomates ukrainiens charg?s, ? Paris, de dissiper chaque nouveau malentendu.

Le 7 f?vrier 2022, avant m?me le d?clenchement de l’offensive russe et alors que les services de renseignement am?ricains pr?voient une attaque imminente, M. Macron avait surpris son monde en se rendant ? Moscou pour une tentative de m?diation d?sesp?r?e. Offense : il pr?f?re ne passer que le lendemain seulement par l’Ukraine, o? sa visite ?tait pourtant esp?r?e de longue date. Dans le vol entre Moscou et Kiev, il d?taille les engagements que M. Poutine aurait pris devant lui la veille : ne pas attaquer l’Ukraine, retirer les troupes stationn?es en Bi?lorussie pour ce que le Kremlin pr?sente encore comme des « exercices »…

La vice-pr?sidente du Parlement europ?en Eva Kaili a ?t? ?crou?e, dimanche 11 d?cembre, ? Bruxelles, dans le cadre d’une enqu?te pour corruption men?e par un juge belge. La d?put?e grecque est accus?e d’avoir re?u d’importants versements d’argent pour infl?chir ses d?cisions au Parlement en faveur du Qatar. Trois autres personnes ont ?galement ?t? emprisonn?es.

Elle vantait un pays « ? la pointe en mati?re de droits du travail, abolissant la kafala [un syst?me de tutelle des employeurs sur les travailleurs] ». Des ONG alertent pourtant depuis plusieurs ann?es sur la situation des travailleurs migrants au Qatar. Le 2 novembre dernier, le ministre du travail qatari, Ali Ben Samikh Al-Marri, avait rejet? l’appel de plusieurs ONG ? cr?er un fonds d’indemnisation pour les travailleurs migrants tu?s ou bless?s sur les chantiers de construction des infrastructures du tournoi, d?non?ant un « coup de communication ».

Des membres de l’organisation ?tat islamique (EI) ont attaqu? lundi 12 d?cembre l’h?tel Longan de Kaboul, fr?quent? par des hommes d’affaires chinois.

Le groupe a d?clar? que deux de ses membres « ont attaqu? un grand h?tel fr?quent? par des diplomates et des hommes d’affaires chinois ? Kaboul, o? ils ont fait exploser deux engins explosifs cach?s dans deux sacs », l’un visant une f?te pour les invit?s chinois et l’autre le hall de r?ception. L’un des deux combattants a lanc? des grenades ? main sur des officiers talibans qui tentaient de les arr?ter, tandis que l’autre a commenc? ? faire exploser des engins explosifs qu’il avait coll?s sur les portes des chambres d’h?tel et ? tirer sur les clients de l’h?tel, a d?clar? l’EI dans un communiqu?.

Un h?pital a fait ?tat de trois morts et 18 bless?s, tandis que les talibans ont ?voqu? deux ?trangers bless?s et affirm? que trois assaillants avaient ?t? tu?s. L’ONG Emergency, qui g?re un h?pital de la capitale o? ont ?t? transport?es des victimes, a ?crit dans un tweet avoir re?u « 21 bless?s » et que « trois ?taient d?j? morts » ? leur arriv?e, sans pr?ciser s’il s’agissait des assaillants. Les talibans, de leur c?t?, ont affirm? que trois assaillants avaient ?t? tu?s et deux ?trangers bless?s.

« Tous les clients de l’h?tel ont ?t? secourus et aucun ?tranger n’a ?t? tu?. Seuls deux clients ?trangers ont ?t? bless?s lorsqu’ils ont saut? de l’?tage sup?rieur » de l’?tablissement, a expliqu? le porte-parole des talibans, Zabihullah Mujahid, dans la soir?e. L’attaque perp?tr?e contre l’h?tel, situ? dans l’une des principales zones commerciales de la capitale, a pris fin avec « la mort de trois assaillants », a-t-il ajout?.

Un porte-parole de la police de Kaboul a ?galement confirm? que « trois assaillants avaient ?t? tu?s sur place et qu’un suspect avait ?t? arr?t? », attribuant l’assaut ? des « ?l?ments malveillants ».

Cinq explosions et plusieurs tirs en rafale
Dans des vid?os post?es sur les r?seaux sociaux, on peut voir des flammes au premier ?tage et des r?sidents de l’h?tel se pr?cipiter aux fen?tres. Des journalistes de l’Agence France-Presse ont ?galement pu voir un ?pais panache de fum?e s’?chapper de l’h?tel. Plusieurs t?moins ont rapport? avoir entendu au moins cinq explosions et plusieurs tirs en rafale. L’h?tel Longan de Kaboul, un complexe ? plusieurs ?tages, est tr?s pris? des hommes d’affaires chinois qui sont de plus en plus nombreux ? se rendre en Afghanistan depuis le retour des talibans au pouvoir.

P?kin n’a pas reconnu officiellement le gouvernement taliban, mais la Chine, qui partage 76 kilom?tres de fronti?re avec l’Afghanistan, est l’un des rares pays ? y avoir maintenu une pr?sence diplomatique.

P?kin craint depuis longtemps que l’Afghanistan devienne un point de chute pour des s?paratistes de la minorit? ou?goure pers?cut?e, venant de la tr?s sensible r?gion chinoise frontali?re du Xinjiang. Les talibans ont promis que l’Afghanistan ne serait pas utilis? comme base pour les militants ou?gours. En ?change, la Chine leur a offert un soutien ?conomique et des investissements pour la reconstruction du pays.

Le maintien de la stabilit? en Afghanistan, apr?s vingt ans de guerre avec les Am?ricains et les forces de l’Otan, est la principale pr?occupation de P?kin, qui cherche ? s?curiser ses fronti?res et ses investissements strat?giques au Pakistan, leur voisin commun.

De nombreux attentats ? la bombe perp?tr?s ces derniers mois
Les talibans comptent ?galement sur la Chine pour transformer l’un des plus grands gisements de cuivre du monde en usine mini?re. Une exploitation qui serait pr?cieuse pour redresser le pays, ? court d’argent et frapp? par les sanctions ?conomiques internationales.

Bien qu’elle d?tienne les droits sur de grands projets en Afghanistan, notamment la mine de cuivre de Mes Aynak, dans la province du Logar (est), la Chine n’a fait avancer aucun de ces projets.

Les talibans affirment avoir am?lior? la s?curit? dans le pays depuis leur retour au pouvoir en ao?t 2021, mais de nombreux attentats ? la bombe ont ?t? perp?tr?s ces derniers mois, g?n?ralement revendiqu?s par la section locale du groupe jihadiste Etat islamique au Khorassan (EI-K).

Ce n’est pas la premi?re fois que des ?trangers sont vis?s. Le 2 d?cembre, un agent de s?curit? avait ?t? bless? par des coups de feu tir?s sur l’ambassade du Pakistan ? Kaboul. Le groupe Etat islamique avait revendiqu? l’attaque, confirmant avoir vis? le chef de mission.

Deux employ?s de l’ambassade russe ? Kaboul et quatre Afghans avaient ?galement ?t? tu?s le 5 septembre aux abords du b?timent, dans un attentat-suicide revendiqu? l? aussi par l’EI-K.

« Coal, cars, cash and trees [charbon, voitures, argent et arbres] » : en novembre 2021, le gouvernement britannique avait trouv? un slogan plut?t efficace pour r?sumer son action en tant qu’h?te de la COP26 ? Glasgow (Ecosse). Il s’agissait de promouvoir la fin du charbon dans le monde, la transition vers les voitures ?lectriques, les financements pour aider ? la transition ?nerg?tique et ? la plantation d’arbres.

Un an plus tard, en contradiction flagrante avec ces engagements, et alors que le pays ?tait sur le point de renoncer au charbon – la derni?re mine en exploitation au Royaume-Uni, ? Kellingley dans le Yorkshire, a ferm? en d?cembre 2015 –, Londres vient d’autoriser l’ouverture d’une nouvelle mine sur son territoire.

Le projet, en gestation depuis au moins trois ans mais tr?s controvers?, a ?t? approuv? par Michael Gove, le ministre charg? de l’?galit? des territoires, et devrait cr?er environ 500 emplois ? Whitehaven, en Cumbrie, un comt? tr?s rural du nord-ouest de l’Angleterre, fameux pour sa r?gion des lacs (le « Lake district »). C’est la premi?re fois en presque trente ans que le creusement d’une nouvelle mine re?oit un feu vert des autorit?s britanniques ; la derni?re en date ? avoir ?t? excav?e ayant ?t? celle d’Asfordby, pr?s de Leicester, dans les Midlands, ? partir de 1987.

Le Royaume-Uni fut l’un des tout premiers producteurs de charbon au monde jusqu’au d?but du XXe si?cle – c’est l’usage de cette roche comme combustible qui a permis la premi?re r?volution industrielle – mais le pays y a pratiquement renonc? : seul 1 % de l’?lectricit? y est produit ? partir de charbon.

Tr?s mauvais signal
La mine de Whitehaven pourrait extraire jusqu’? 2,5 millions de tonnes de charbon ? coke (combustible) par an. Sa production est destin?e ? l’exportation et devrait aller exclusivement ? l’industrie";https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2022/12/13/au-royaume-uni-le-gouvernement-cree-la-polemique-en-autorisant-l-ouverture-d-une-mine-de-charbon_6154106_3244.html

L’Afrique a rendez-vous ? Washington. L’administration Biden a d?cid? de manifester son int?r?t renouvel? pour le continent en organisant un sommet multilat?ral dans sa capitale, huit ans apr?s le pr?c?dent. Du 13 au 15 d?cembre se r?uniront quarante-neuf d?l?gations gouvernementales, l’Union africaine, des repr?sentants des soci?t?s civiles, du monde des affaires et des diasporas.

A cette occasion, Joe Biden annoncera le soutien de son pays ? l’attribution d’un statut de membre permanent ? l’Union africaine lors des sommets du G20, auxquels participait jusqu’alors l’Afrique du Sud. « Nous avons besoin de plus de voix africaines dans les conversations internationales concernant l’?conomie globale, la d?mocratie et la gouvernance, le changement climatique, la sant? et la s?curit? », a expliqu? dans un communiqu? Judd Devermont, directeur pour les affaires africaines au Conseil am?ricain de s?curit? nationale.

Ce sommet de trois jours ne devrait pas ?tre marqu? par des annonces spectaculaires. Ce qui fait son sel est la multiplicit? ? venir des interactions, des apart?s, des rencontres officielles et impromptues. Il s’agit, selon un haut responsable am?ricain, d’« ?couter et de r?pondre aux aspirations africaines ». La majorit? des dirigeants du continent est attendue ? Washington. Les seuls ? ne pas avoir ?t? invit?s par l’administration sont les putschistes (Burkina Faso, Guin?e, Mali, Soudan) dont les pays ont ?t? suspendus par l’Union africaine. L’Erythr?e, avec laquelle Washington n’a pas de relations diplomatiques, sera aussi absente.

« Je suis heureux que ce sommet ait lieu, c’est une fa?on tardive d’entrer en jeu, alors qu’il existe des formats similaires entre l’Union europ?enne et l’Afrique, la France et l’Afrique, le Japon et l’Afrique, etc., depuis longtemps, explique J. Peter Pham, ancien envoy? sp?cial am?ricain dans la r?gion des Grands Lacs puis au Sahel sous l’administration Trump, aujourd’hui expert au cercle de r?flexion Atlantic Council. Mais le profil de ce sommet me semble un peu bizarre et condescendant. On fait venir des dirigeants africains pour les soumettre ensuite ? des cours et ? des panels de discussion qui ressemblent ? des s?minaires. »

Disponibilit? et optimisme
L’administration Biden, elle, pr?tend concevoir cet ?v?nement avec un m?lange de disponibilit? et d’optimisme, dans un contexte international instable, marqu? par deux ?v?nements majeurs.

D’abord, les r?verb?rations de la guerre en Ukraine. « De nombreux pays sur le continent, malheureusement, ont subi les cons?quences de l’agression russe et l’impact que cela a eu sur les exportations de bl? et de fertilisants en provenance d’Ukraine », soulignait il y a quelques jours un haut responsable am?ricain, lors d’un point presse. L’absence de condamnation politique claire de l’invasion russe a aussi montr? ? Washington l’importance d’un travail diplomatique proactif aupr?s des dirigeants africains, dont les r?ticences vis-?-vis des points de vue strictement occidentaux vont croissant.

Finies les contraintes g?ographiques des num?ros de t?l?phone fixe. A partir du 1er janvier 2023, les clients des op?rateurs de t?l?phonie pourront conserver leur num?ro de t?l?phone fixe (commen?ant par 01, 02, 03, 04 ou 05) en cas de d?m?nagement dans une autre zone de France m?tropolitaine. Il s’agit de l’entr?e en vigueur d’une d?cision du r?gulateur des t?l?coms, l’Arcep, de juillet 2019.

Jusqu’au 31 d?cembre 2022, chaque num?ro g?ographique commen?ant par 01, 02, 03, 04 ou 05 est associ? ? l’une des cinq grandes zones segmentant le territoire m?tropolitain, elles-m?mes subdivis?es en 412 zones plus petites, appel?es zone de num?rotation ?l?mentaire (ZNE). L’utilisateur final doit alors n?cessairement utiliser un num?ro correspondant ? cette ZNE.

? partir du 1er janvier 2023, un habitant de Lyon dont le num?ro de t?l?phone fixe commence par 04 et qui d?m?nage ? Rennes pourra conserver son num?ro de t?l?phone fixe. Un nouvel abonn? fixe habitant ? Rennes pourra ?galement demander ? son op?rateur, s’il le souhaite, que son num?ro ne commence pas par 02, explique l’Arcep dans une note explicative.

G?n?ralisation de la VoIP
« Les num?ros fixes en outre-mer restent propres ? chaque territoire et tout abonn? peut d?m?nager au sein de son territoire en conservant son num?ro. En revanche, il n’est toujours pas possible de conserver son num?ro fixe en d?m?nageant dans un autre territoire ultramarin ou en m?tropole », compl?te l’Autorit? de r?gulation des t?l?coms.

Pourquoi un tel changement ? Au niveau technologique, cette ?volution a ?t? rendue possible par « la g?n?ralisation » des communications par Internet (ou voix sur IP ou VoIP) pour les appels de t?l?phonie fixe, « qui a lev? des contraintes g?ographiques qui existaient auparavant », explique l’Arcep.

Elle r?pond surtout ? un « besoin pratique » pour les particuliers et ? un enjeu ?conomique pour les entreprises, compl?te-t-elle. « Un d?m?nagement de quelques kilom?tres, dans une commune voisine situ?e dans une ZNE diff?rente, suffisait pour qu’une entreprise soit confront?e ? la perte de son num?ro de t?l?phone fixe », explique-t-elle.";https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2022/12/12/la-degeographisation-pour-les-numeros-de-telephone-fixe-entrera-en-vigueur-le-1er-janvier-2023_6154099_3224.html

La crise sanitaire li?e ? la pand?mie de Covid-19 a-t-elle eu un impact sur la consommation de tabac ? C’est l’hypoth?se que fait Sant? publique France (SPF) dans son dernier barom?tre sur la pr?valence du tabagisme en France en 2021, paru lundi 12 d?cembre.

« Un impact de la crise sociale et ?conomique li?e au Covid-19 qui a suivi ne peut ?tre exclu concernant l’interruption de la baisse de la pr?valence du tabagisme en France et la hausse observ?e parmi certaines populations », explique SPF dans sa note. Entre 2014 et 2019, une baisse in?dite avait pourtant ?t? observ?e en France parmi les adultes (de 28,5 % ? 24 %).

Selon SPF, le nombre de fumeurs est estim? ? 15 millions en France, dont 12 millions de fumeurs quotidiens. Sur ce total, on compte 5,5 millions de fumeuses quotidiennes – quelque 7 millions, si l’on inclut les fumeuses occasionnelles. Apr?s une forte diminution entre 2017 et 2019, le tabagisme f?minin est reparti ? la hausse, et ce, dans toutes les tranches d’?ge, sauf chez les 25-34 ans, l’?ge o? l’on envisage souvent une maternit? et o? l’incitation ? ne pas commencer ? fumer ou ? arr?ter est forte.

Il a fallu se rendre ? l’?vidence. Un peu plus de trois mois apr?s le lancement du Conseil national de la refondation (CNR), pr?sent? par Emmanuel Macron en juin comme une « r?volution culturelle », l’instance reste un objet d?mocratique mal identifi?. Un « machin », d?noncent en ch?ur les oppositions. Mais le chef de l’Etat ne veut pas renoncer ? ce qui doit illustrer sa « nouvelle m?thode » de gouvernement.

Lundi 12 d?cembre, face aux doutes persistants, le pr?sident de la R?publique a donc tent? de relancer son chantier titanesque et chronophage qui vise ? mettre autour d’une m?me table les responsables politiques, associatifs, les citoyens ou les fonctionnaires pour aborder les probl?mes du pays, lors de la deuxi?me session pl?ni?re du CNR.

Une r?union organis?e ? l’Elys?e, aux c?t?s du pr?sident de cette instance, le patron du MoDem, Fran?ois Bayrou, et de la premi?re ministre, Elisabeth Borne. « L’int?r?t de la m?thode demeure », a assur? M. Macron, en d?pit du boycott persistant de l’ensemble des partis d’opposition. « La dynamique est f?conde. » A ses yeux, le CNR d?clin? en ateliers nationaux et territoriaux permet d’aborder des probl?mes sans « bureaucratiser les concertations », ni « scinder les gens par cat?gorie ».

Cavalcade
Certes, depuis le lancement de cet outil cens? permettre davantage de « concertation », le 8 septembre ?

Depuis plusieurs jours, la France traverse un ?pisode de froid marqu? par des temp?ratures en dessous des normales saisonni?res (6,06 degr?s sur la p?riode 1990-2020). A Paris, le plan Grand Froid pour h?berger davantage de personnes sans domicile a ?t? lanc? ? Paris lundi 12 d?cembre. « Ce lundi 12 d?cembre ? 16 heures en raison des temp?ratures hivernales, le plan Grand Froid a ?t? d?clench? ? Paris », ?crit dans un communiqu? la pr?fecture d’Ile-de-France.

Le plan Grand Froid est d?clench? par l’Etat lorsque les temp?ratures minimales ressenties descendent ? des niveaux tr?s bas, proches de ? 18 degr?s. Il consiste ? ouvrir des places d’accueil d’urgence dans des b?timents publics non pr?vus ? cet effet, comme des gymnases ou des ?coles, afin de prot?ger les personnes sans domicile. Les pr?fets peuvent ?galement augmenter les moyens humains et financiers d?di?s aux maraudes ou au 115, le num?ro d’urgence pour les personnes sans abri.

Mardi, M?t?o-France pr?voit des temp?ratures minimales n?gatives en Ile-de-France, dans les Hauts-de-France et le Grand-Est notamment, apr?s plusieurs jours de temp?ratures inf?rieures aux normales saisonni?res.

« D?s samedi 10 d?cembre, des places compl?mentaires ont ?t? ouvertes ? Paris pour accueillir les personnes signal?es lors des maraudes ou par le 115 », explique la pr?fecture d’Ile-de-France, sans pr?ciser le nombre exact de places ouvertes. Trente places ont ?t? ouvertes dans les locaux de la pr?fecture « pour accueillir des femmes isol?es », et « une centaine » suppl?mentaires pour les « femmes, (les) familles et (les) hommes isol?s » doivent l’?tre « dans les prochaines heures », selon la pr?fecture.

Le ministre d?l?gu? ? la ville et au logement, Olivier Klein, a de son c?t? demand? aux pr?fets de recenser les b?timents ? m?me d’offrir des places d’h?bergement temporaires, en plus des quelque 198 000 disponibles dans le pays. « Je demande aux pr?fets de r?gion (…) d’analyser l’ensemble des sites vacants sur leurs territoires, en s’appuyant sur la liste mise ? disposition par la direction immobili?re de l’Etat.

Apr?s trois semaines de comp?tition et deux jours sans match, la Coupe du monde reprend ses droits mardi 13 d?cembre, avec la premi?re demi-finale opposant les Argentins aux Croates, finalistes en 2018.

Apr?s s’?tre mise sur la route de Neymar et des Br?siliens en quarts de finale (1-1, 4-2 aux tirs au but), la Croatie va au devant d’un nouvel obstacle, l’Argentine. Heureusement, elle peut compter sur « le meilleur milieu du monde » (Marcelo Brozovic, Mateo Kovacic et Luka Modric), selon les mots de son s?lectionneur, Zlatko Dalic. « Quand on leur passe le ballon, c’est plus s?r que de laisser son argent ? la banque », compl?te le d?fenseur Josip Juranovic. De quoi aborder sereinement une rencontre face ? une ?quipe qui compte dans ses rangs Lionel Messi : « Nous n’avons pas de plan sp?cifique anti-Messi, en tout cas pas pour l’instant, assurait l’attaquant croate Bruno Petkovic, apr?s la victoire contre le Br?sil. Notre approche est de nous concentrer sur le fait d’arr?ter toute l’?quipe, pas juste un joueur. L’Argentine, ce n’est pas que Messi. »

Certes. Reste que le num?ro 10 argentin, toujours en qu?te d’un premier titre mondial pour sa derni?re apparition en Coupe du monde, est en grande forme. D?j? buteur ? quatre reprises, il a marqu? sur penalty et d?livr? une superbe passe d?cisive ? Nahuel Molina en quarts de finale, avant d’inscrire son tir au but contre les Pays-Bas (2-2, 4-3 t.a.b.). L’int?ress? a toutefois d?j? pr?venu les siens : « La Croatie a prouv? qu’elle ?tait tr?s bonne, elle a su battre le Br?sil. C’est une ?quipe qui travaille depuis plusieurs Coupes du monde avec ce s?lectionneur, ils se connaissent tr?s bien, ils s’entendent tr?s bien, et ?a va ?tre tr?s dur. »";https://www.lemonde.fr/football/article/2022/12/12/coupe-du-monde-2022-avec-le-meilleur-milieu-du-monde-la-croatie-se-prepare-a-son-match-contre-l-argentine_6154093_1616938.html

Les index point?s vers le ciel d’Olivier Giroud quand il a inscrit son 52e but avec l’?quipe de France, les incantations du Br?silien Thiago Silva avant d’affronter la Croatie en quarts de finale, les pri?res de la maman du gardien de but marocain, Yassine Bounou, pour l’aider ? stopper le tir au but d’un joueur espagnol, en huiti?mes de finale… Comme dans chaque grande comp?tition, la religion est omnipr?sente lors de cette Coupe du monde 2022, la premi?re organis?e dans un pays musulman, o? retentissent cinq fois par jour les appels ? la pri?re.

Comme l’a maladroitement remarqu? un c?l?bre journaliste de radio fran?ais, on aper?oit en effet de nombreuses mosqu?es ? Doha et ses environs. Mais, dans ce pays sunnite wahhabite, moins rigoriste que son voisin saoudien, il existe aussi un lieu de culte chr?tien, un vaste « complexe religieux » ?difi? au-del? du p?riph?rique F, dans une zone ?loign?e des gratte-ciel de la corniche et de West Bay, o? l’asphalte et le b?ton composent encore avec le sable.

Le vendredi, jusqu’? dix-sept messes sont prononc?es dans une dizaine de langues ainsi qu’une c?r?monie de bapt?me. Plusieurs milliers de croyants convergent vers le site, notamment des Indiens du Kerala, des Philippins ou des Sud-Cor?ens bien install?s au Qatar. Mais aussi des jeunes catholiques africains arriv?s depuis peu et souvent regroup?s dans des camps de travail. Laiss?s au repos le vendredi, ils trouvent l? un moment de respiration dans leur rythme infernal. « Notre quotidien, c’est travailler dur, dormir, travailler dur, dormir », r?sume Collins, un K?nyan de 22 ans employ? dans une boulangerie industrielle.

Son documentaire sur Georges Marchais (1920-1997), ancien secr?taire g?n?ral du Parti communiste fran?ais (PCF), G?rard Miller l’a con?u comme un cheminement multiple. D’abord g?ographique : depuis la Normandie natale du futur dirigeant ouvrier jusqu’? sa derni?re demeure ? Champigny-sur-Marne (Val-de-Marne) en passant par Malakoff (Hauts-de-Seine). Puis, int?rieur : on suit l’itin?raire de ce fils d’agriculteurs, apolitique, enfant de ch?ur, r?vant de devenir ouvrier, d’abord m?fiant ? l’?gard du communisme avant d’en devenir l’une des principales figures mondiales. Politique, enfin, quand, jeune militant, il gravit rapidement les ?chelons de l’appareil, revendiquant une libert? certaine mais pouvant se montrer ?galement « sans ?tats d’?me » quand il s’agira de purger certains opposants internes.

La famille de Georges Marchais tient une place de choix dans ce r?cit, ouvrant ses archives, partageant ses souvenirs

Tout cela, G?rard Miller le raconte avec talent dans son film (coproduit par Morgane Production et Deux Caf?s l’addition, en coproduction avec France T?l?visions), qui sera projet? au si?ge du Parti communiste, ? Paris, mercredi 14 d?cembre. Tout un symbole : il y a tout juste cinquante ans, en d?cembre 1972, donc, Georges Marchais acc?dait au poste le plus important du PCF. A l’?poque, ce n’?tait pas rien. Le PCF ?tait, avec le Parti communiste italien, le plus important du monde occidental. Il avait la main sur la CGT et ?tait le principal parti de gauche, bien plus fort et implant? que le Parti socialiste (PS) qui venait de se refonder ? Epinay (Seine-Saint-Denis), six mois plus t?t, pla?ant ? sa t?te Fran?ois Mitterrand. Les choses changeront radicalement en moins de dix ans.

Si la p?riode – longue de plus de vingt ans – o? Georges Marchais dirigeait le PCF constitue le c?ur du documentaire, sa famille (nombreuse) tient une place de choix dans ce r?cit, ouvrant ses archives, partageant ses souvenirs, d?taillant certaines sc?nes de la vie quotidienne. On retiendra ainsi le r?cit de deux des filles Marchais qui expliquent combien ils furent tous heureux quand, pour la premi?re fois, au d?but des ann?es 1960, ils eurent une salle de bains dans leur logement.

Zones d’ombre
G?rard Miller interviewe ?galement de nombreuses figures du parti, les anciens dirigeants Robert Hue, Marie-Georges Buffet, Pierre Laurent ou encore l’actuel secr?taire national, Fabien Roussel. Tous racontent « Georges » tel qu’il ?tait, avec un c?t? fonci?rement attachant mais aussi certaines zones d’ombre ou passages de sa vie pas forc?ment glorieux.

C’est d’ailleurs l’une des forces de ce documentaire : ne pas ?tre hagiographique. Sans s’appesantir dessus, il raconte comme le jeune Marchais a ?t? r?quisitionn? pour aller travailler en Allemagne en 1942 et comment ce fut utilis? contre lui, bien des ann?es plus tard, par ses adversaires au sein et ? l’ext?rieur du PCF. Sont aussi ?voqu?s ses ?crits dans L’Humanit?, en mai 1968, contre les « gauchistes » et leur leader, Daniel Cohn-Bendit.

Enfin, G?rard Miller explique comment, ? partir de la fin des ann?es 1970, en r?action aux premiers signes de d?clin de son parti, Marchais reniera tout ce qu’il avait fait pr?c?demment, notamment la prise de distance avec l’URSS sur la question d?mocratique, pour se rapprocher du « grand fr?re » sovi?tique, allant jusqu’? juger son bilan « globalement positif » et justifier l’invasion de l’Afghanistan. Au final, un portrait passionnant et tout en nuances d’un dirigeant politique bien plus complexe qu’il n’y para?t.

C’est par surprise qu’Emmanuel Macron a fait savoir, lundi 12 d?cembre, que la pr?sentation du projet de r?forme des retraites ?tait report?e au 10 janvier. Le pr?sident a affirm? vouloir laisser aux syndicats et nouveaux dirigeants de partis, ?lus ou d?sign?s ces derniers jours, le temps « d’?changer » ? nouveau avec l’ex?cutif sur le texte. Mais les organisations syndicales consid?rent pour beaucoup que « prolonger cette concertation de deux semaines ou d’un mois ne change rien », au regard du cap d?j? fix? par l’ex?cutif d’un report de l’?ge de d?part ? la retraite. D?non?ant l’absence de n?gociations en bonne et due forme, elles appellent d?j? ? une « mobilisation unitaire » contre la r?forme au mois de janvier.

Concertation contre n?gociation, que recouvrent ces deux notions ici oppos?es ? Pourquoi concerte-t-on plus qu’on ne n?gocie en France ? Et qu’est-ce que cela dit de l’?tat du dialogue social ? Dans un entretien au Monde, le sociohistorien St?phane Sirot, sp?cialiste des relations sociales et du syndicalisme, estime que si la question des retraites « complique la possibilit? d’engager un processus de n?gociation », « le d?ficit de recherche de compromis » de la part du gouvernement actuel « n’aide pas ? apaiser le climat social ». De quoi la n?gociation est-elle le nom ?
St?phane Sirot : La n?gociation est l’une des voies possibles au dialogue social qui peut s’instaurer entre l’Etat et les partenaires sociaux, mais aussi en entreprise. Il s’agit de sa forme la plus aboutie, dans la mesure o? elle vise ? d?boucher sur la signature d’un accord commun entre les diff?rentes parties prenantes d?fendant chacune leurs int?r?ts, apr?s avoir trouv? un compromis au fil de discussions.

En France, une n?gociation collective annuelle est obligatoire en entreprise depuis 1982. La loi Larcher de 2007 pr?voit de son c?t? l’obligation pour l’Etat de mettre en place une n?gociation en amont de « tout projet de r?forme » relatif au travail, ? l’emploi et ? la formation professionnelle.

Le dialogue social recouvre toutefois deux autres pratiques compl?mentaires ? la n?gociation : la consultation et la concertation. La premi?re permet d’?couter l’avis des diff?rentes parties prenantes concern?es par une ?ventuelle mesure, sans que celui-ci ne soit n?cessairement pris en compte lors de la d?cision. La concertation va un peu plus loin dans l’id?e que ces discussions pourraient aboutir ? une ?ventuelle prise en compte de certains des int?r?ts avanc?s, sans engager davantage les d?cisionnaires.

Dans ces deux cas de figure, le pouvoir ?coute mais tranche seul. C’est pr?cis?ment ce qu’il s’est pass? concernant le projet de r?forme des retraites : l’ex?cutif a consult? et concert? les syndicats, tout en affirmant tout au long de ces discussions garder la main sur la r?forme.

Justement, en France, la consultation et la concertation semblent supplanter la n?gociation dans la pratique du dialogue social. Comment l’expliquer ?
La n?gociation n’est pas le mode privil?gi? du dialogue social en France en raison de notre histoire politique et de la mani?re dont s’est construit l’Etat. Il est en effet monnaie courante pour le pouvoir en place de consid?rer que, puisqu’il poss?de la l?gitimit? d?mocratique, c’est ? lui de d?cider de la substance de la loi.

D?s la R?volution, notre pays a institutionnalis? un rapport de force entre l’Etat et les corps interm?diaires, en interdisant en premier lieu la formation de corporations et de « coalitions », soit de gr?ves et d’organisations, avec la loi Le Chapelier (1791). Le renforcement de la centralisation politique d?j? ? l’?uvre a alors ?t? un moyen de s’assurer qu’il n’y ait plus d’« obstacles » entre l’Etat et les citoyens.

Seule une p?riode de notre histoire contemporaine a vraiment fait exception : l’apr?s-guerre. Les grandes r?formes ?conomiques et sociales port?es par le Conseil national de la R?sistance (CNR) ?taient une synth?se des aspirations et revendications des diff?rents partis et syndicats, soit un compromis n? de n?gociations.

Mais cela n’a pas perdur?, car nous ne sommes pas all?s au bout de l’application du programme du CNR en mati?re de dialogue social. L’instauration de la Ve R?publique a ensuite renforc? une pratique verticale du pouvoir et de la fabrique de la d?cision.

Cette histoire politique, qui encourage peu la n?gociation, explique-t-elle pourquoi la France fait exception sur la sc?ne europ?enne ?
Tout ? fait. Cette conception conflictuelle continue d’impr?gner notre imaginaire et notre pratique du dialogue social. Elle marque notre diff?rence par rapport aux autres pays d’Europe en la mati?re, alors qu’il y est davantage institutionnalis? et apais?. La France a notamment accumul? un retard dans le monde de l’entreprise. En 1946, nous avons par exemple fait le choix de constitutionnaliser le droit de gr?ve sans consacrer de vrai contre-pouvoir pour les salari?s. Il a fallu attendre la mobilisation de Mai 68 pour que la France accorde enfin plus pleinement le droit syndical en entreprise, alors que nous ?tions l’un des derniers pays ? ne pas l’avoir fait. Auparavant, en 1945, le choix a ?t? fait par ailleurs de seulement laisser aux comit?s d’entreprise la gestion des « ?uvres sociales », sans droit de regard ou d’intervention sur les d?cisions strat?giques.

Depuis 2017, les partenaires sociaux ne cessent de d?noncer la m?thode « brutale » de prise de d?cisions d’Emmanuel Macron, estimant qu’il met en sc?ne le dialogue sans pour autant prendre en compte leur avis…
Emmanuel Macron a une conception verticale du pouvoir : il estime que c’est au gouvernement de d?cider de l’essentiel de la loi, et non pas aux oppositions parlementaires et aux organisations syndicales. Pour lui, le cadre d’intervention l?gitime des syndicats est celui de l’entreprise. C’est pourquoi ses gouvernements successifs ont consult?, davantage que n?goci? – sauf sur les sujets consensuels ou pour lesquels ils y ont ?t? oblig?s.

Cette conception du dialogue social se retranscrit aussi dans le champ s?mantique : le gouvernement prend grande pr?caution ? ne pas employer le terme de n?gociation, sachant que ce processus de discussions ne l’aurait pas engag? au m?me niveau. En lui pr?f?rant le mot de concertation, cela revient ? faire comprendre que c’est bien lui qui est ma?tre des d?cisions, peu importe le nombre de fois o? il a rencontr? les syndicats.

Cette mani?re de faire explique qu’il entretient depuis cinq ans des relations plut?t conflictuelles avec les partenaires sociaux, qui eux ne cessent de fustiger sa m?thode. A chaque cycle de discussions, ils r?p?tent qu’il ne m?ne ? rien, ? l’image de ce qu’on a entendu autour de la nouvelle r?forme des retraites. Ces critiques sont d’autant plus notables qu’elles ?manent aussi de syndicats dits r?formistes et les plus enclins au dialogue, comme la CFDT.

L’absence de volont? politique d’engager des n?gociations sur la r?forme des retraites suffit-elle ? expliquer la tension du climat social ?
Il faut d’abord noter que la question des retraites est par d?finition un sujet qui complique la possibilit? d’engager un processus de n?gociation, parce que les r?formes qui s’accumulent depuis trente ans en la mati?re remettent successivement en cause la retraite ? 60 ans. Or celle-ci est consid?r?e comme une conqu?te sociale par la gauche et beaucoup de syndicats, et sa remise en cause est per?ue comme une r?gression. De fait, revenir sur l’?ge de d?part ? la retraite ou la dur?e de cotisation entra?ne presque toujours de la conflictualit?.

Mais il est clair que le d?ficit de recherche de compromis de la part du gouvernement sur le sujet n’aide pas ? apaiser le climat social. Cela avait d?j? ?t? le cas lors des discussions autour du pr?c?dent projet de loi sur les retraites, qui a finalement ?t? abandonn?. Emmanuel Macron et son gouvernement souhaitaient mettre en place un syst?me de retraite ? points et la CFDT, favorable ? une r?forme syst?mique, n’y ?tait pas oppos?e. Ils auraient pu abandonner leur souhait de mettre en outre en place une r?forme param?trique, ? laquelle le syndicat n’adh?rait pas, pour trouver plus ais?ment un accord avec lui, mais ne l’ont pas fait.

L’autre probl?me, qui explique l’?lectrisation du d?bat, est que nous ne savons pas prendre notre temps pour r?former. Or la question du temps est ins?parable de celle de la n?gociation : on ne peut pas arriver ? un compromis dans la pr?cipitation.

La preuve en est avec l’exemple de la r?forme des retraites de 2010 : alors que la loi a ?t? adopt?e rapidement sur fond de forte contestation sociale, au m?me moment, les Pays-Bas r?formaient eux aussi leur syst?me de retraites. Mais eux y sont parvenus de mani?re plus apais?e, au terme d’un processus de n?gociations ?tendu sur deux ann?es (2009-2010). D?s lors qu’un contre-pouvoir ne peut pas utiliser efficacement la n?gociation pour faire valoir ses int?r?ts, il utilise ce qui lui reste : le rapport de force. C’est pr?cis?ment ce qui caract?rise l’?tat du dialogue social en France aujourd’hui.";https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2022/12/12/reforme-des-retraites-la-negociation-n-est-pas-le-mode-privilegie-du-dialogue-social-en-france-en-raison-de-notre-histoire-politique_6154086_823448.html
0;« Paroles de lecteurs » - Fin de vie : arr?tons de chercher ? faire peur;"[Dans une tribune publi?e dans Le Monde,] Th?o Boer d?conseille de l?gif?rer sur l’aide active ? mourir en s’appuyant sur sa perception de l’exp?rience n?erlandaise. Ses modes de raisonnement, pourtant contestables, peuvent faire peur. Il cite l’augmentation du nombre d’actes d’euthanasie au fil des ann?es.

N’est-il pas raisonnable de les permettre quand il s’agit de personnes qui ne souhaitent plus vivre parce qu’elles souffrent de maladies graves et incurables, provoquant des souffrances inapaisables, et dont la mort est in?luctable ? Est-il acceptable d’admettre une aide ? mourir pour un petit nombre de personnes qui souffrent de mani?re insupportable, mais de la refuser sous pr?texte que leur nombre augmente ?

Th?o Boer s’inqui?te en disant que la pratique s’est ?tendue ? plus de situations : aux personnes souffrant de maladies chroniques, aux personnes handicap?es, ? celles souffrant de probl?mes psychiatriques et aux enfants. Il ?voque une pente glissante o? les euthanasies pourraient s’?tendre ? ceux qui « souffrent du manque de sens, de marginalisation, de solitude, de la vie elle-m?me ».

Cet argument de la pente glissante n’est ? mon sens pas valable. Quand on discutait de l’autorisation de l’avortement, certains pr?tendaient qu’? la longue, des avortements en fin de grossesse et m?me des infanticides deviendraient permis, mais cela n’est jamais arriv? depuis que l’IVG a ?t? d?p?nalis?e en France en 1975.

Th?o Boer sous-entend que toutes les extensions sont des d?rives, mais cette notion de d?rive diff?re d’une personne ? une autre. Certains pensent qu’?tendre l’assistance ? mourir ? des enfants ou des malades psychiatriques est toujours inacceptable ; d’autres, que certaines conditions exceptionnelles de souffrance peuvent la justifier. Ces points de vue m?ritent d’?tre d?battus.

En outre, en demander l’interdiction pour cause de d?rives ne tient pas debout non plus. Par exemple, le mariage est associ? ? des d?rives ? en France, une femme meurt tous les trois jours sous la violence de son conjoint ou ex-conjoint ?, pourtant personne n’a jamais propos? d’interdire le mariage. La solution contre toutes d?rives n’est pas d’interdire la pratique en question, mais de mettre en place une l?gislation qui soit appliqu?e de fa?on efficace et qui prot?ge contre les abus.

Th?o Boer s’inqui?te du nombre de rapports dans lesquels les patients demandeurs mentionnent comme une de leurs motivations le d?sir de prot?ger leurs proches, de leur ?viter d’?tre t?moins de leurs souffrances. Il me semble ?vident qu’on ne devrait pas accepter une demande pour une assistance ? mourir qui serait formul?e seulement pour le b?n?fice de tierces personnes. Cependant, si une personne consid?re que sa souffrance est insupportable et qu’aucun traitement ne l’all?ge, il peut ?tre tout ? fait l?gitime que cette personne souhaite une aide ? mourir pour mettre fin ? sa propre souffrance et, en plus, ?pargner ? ses proches de continuer d’?tre t?moins de sa souffrance.

Je r?pondrais ?galement ? M. Boer qu’il convient de d?battre avec nuance, et d’arr?ter de faire peur et de cr?er des angoisses inutiles. Environ 95 % des Fran?ais souhaitent pouvoir choisir une aide ? mourir et 85 % la consid?rent comme un soin de fin de vie. La question qui se pose n’est donc pas de d?cider si on devrait autoriser ou pas l’euthanasie et le suicide assist?, mais plut?t de d?finir dans quelles conditions les permettre, quels moyens employer et quels contr?les mettre en place.";https://www.lemonde.fr/blog-mediateur/article/2022/12/12/paroles-de-lecteurs_6154085_5334984.html

C’est sans doute le sujet qui, depuis la rentr?e de septembre, d?vore le plus les emplois du temps des ?tats-majors, du minist?re des arm?es, de la direction g?n?rale de l’armement et de bon nombre de conseillers sp?cialis?s de Bercy, de l’Elys?e et de Matignon. Mais c’est aussi, secret d?fense oblige, celui sur lequel plane le plus de discr?tion. Les tractations autour de la future loi de programmation militaire (LPM), qui doit planifier le budget n?cessaire pour le mod?le d’arm?e dont la France sera dot?e d’ici ? l’horizon 2030, progressent ? pas lents. Mais, selon nos informations, un certain nombre d’arbitrages d?cisifs devraient enfin ?tre rendus par Emmanuel Macron d’ici ? janvier 2023.

Alors que le texte pourrait ?tre pr?sent? au Parlement ? partir de mars 2023, plusieurs conseils de d?fense doivent ?tre consacr?s ? la LPM d’ici ? No?l. Ces arbitrages pr?sidentiels n’?puiseront pas toutes les tractations. Le fait m?me d’arr?ter une date butoir crispe certains acteurs du dossier. Les grandes lignes du futur projet de loi devraient n?anmoins ?tre bient?t arr?t?es, ? commencer par les ?ventuels renoncements ou d?calages de programmes, notamment de fr?gates, de livraisons de Rafale ou de v?hicules blind?s, qui rendent f?briles les ?tats-majors.

Depuis plusieurs mois, les discussions tournent autour d’une enveloppe de 400 milliards d’euros sur sept ans, allant de 2024 ? 2030. Un budget colossal de 100 milliards de plus que la pr?c?dente LPM, qui couvrait la p?riode 2019-2025, avec 295 milliards d’euros. Mais ce budget appara?t d’ores et d?j? d?vor? par la vertigineuse hausse de l’inflation et des co?ts de l’?nergie, bouscul? par la relance de la course mondiale aux armements, tout en ?tant corset? par la planification de la dissuasion fran?aise, balis?e au moins jusqu’en 2060. « ?a explose de partout », confie un initi?.

Le cyber et le spatial
L’Elys?e aurait cependant choisi de ne pas se bloquer avec les « retex » (retours d’exp?rience) fluctuants de la guerre en Ukraine. « Il ne faut pas tout sacrifier face ? l’urgence des crises actuelles, estime un des principaux acteurs du dossier. L’objectif, c’est de se poser les bonnes questions. Le but n’est pas de d?cider tout de suite d’augmenter ou de diminuer le nombre de chars Leclerc, ce n’est pas ?a l’enjeu. Le but, c’est de d?finir une programmation d’ensemble. » Sur l’enveloppe financi?re g?n?rale, « il n’y a pas de cadrage, assure cette source, contrairement aux chiffres souvent avanc?s.

Avec 3,3 milliards de litres bus en 2020, les Am?ricains sont les champions du monde en mati?re de consommation de vin. Mais aussi d’importation de bouteilles. Autant dire que, plus qu’aucune autre ville des Etats-Unis, New York – cit? cosmopolite, mondialis?e, ais?e – est ? la pointe du ph?nom?ne.

A New York, quand on aime, on aime fort. Quel que soit le prix, car les habitants de Manhattan ont les moyens de leurs plaisirs. Issus de cultures vari?es et acc?dant ? toutes sortes de gastronomies, les New-Yorkais n’avaient qu’? se prendre de passion pour le vin pour que leur ville se retrouve ? l’avant-poste de tout ce que la plan?te viticole est capable de produire en crus rares.

New York boit beaucoup et de tous les continents. La France, en valeur (les bouteilles ch?res), et l’Italie, en volume (le nombre de bouteilles), se disputent la premi?re place des importateurs. Mais, attention ! Ici, il y va du vin comme du reste : tout va vite, tr?s vite. Les tendances surgissent et disparaissent, les go?ts changent et les vitrines des cavistes s’adaptent.

Cette effervescence tient ? une curiosit? insatiable pour les d?couvertes, mais aussi ? l’influence des r?seaux sociaux, selon Maxime Blaise, sommelier au Bernardin, restaurant triplement ?toil? du guide Michelin dans Midtown, ? dix minutes ? pied de Central Park. « Les r?seaux sociaux ont tout rapproch?, a-t-il constat?. Il suffit que, en France, un critique respect? ou un sommelier connu mette en avant une cuv?e, en postant une photo sur Instagram par exemple, et les importateurs se ruent dessus. Si une tendance ?merge ? Paris, elle se r?percute instantan?ment ? New York. »

Le vin orange s’impose
Pas ?tonnant, donc, de d?couvrir chez Astor Wines & Spirits, sur Lafayette Street, institution de Manhattan implant?e pr?s de Washington Square Park, les coqueluches fran?aises et les domaines embl?matiques de nombreuses appellations, bien mieux repr?sent?s que chez nombre de cavistes de l’Hexagone. Dans la section Languedoc : blanc du Mas de Daumas Gassac, rouges du Clos Fantine, « Vieilles Vignes » du Domaine Gauby, entre autres. Le coin du Jura regorge de p?pites.

En mai 2022, la psychiatre qu’elle voyait en lib?ral lui a conseill? d’aller consulter au Centre expert sant? mentale et physique des H?pitaux universitaires de Marseille (AP-HM). Au terme d’une consultation de deux heures et demie, le psychiatre a propos? ? Jeanne un traitement ? base de k?tamine – un anesth?siant utilis? depuis des ann?es en chirurgie v?t?rinaire, ?galement analg?sique. L’effet a ?t? imm?diat. Ses id?es noires ont disparu. Jeanne a l’impression « de revivre ».

La d?pression est la maladie mentale la plus fr?quente et la premi?re cause d’invalidit?. L’Organisation mondiale de la sant? (OMS) estime ? 300 millions le nombre de personnes touch?es. En France, entre 5 % et 15 % de la population conna?tra un ?pisode d?pressif au cours de son existence. Aucun milieu social, aucune tranche d’?ge ne sont ?pargn?s. Les femmes sont deux fois plus souvent concern?es. Le risque de suicide est particuli?rement ?lev?.

Et la crise sanitaire li?e au Covid-19 a pes? sur la sant? mentale des Fran?ais. Selon l’?tude CoviPrev, de Sant? publique France, publi?e mi-septembre, 18 % des personnes interrog?es pr?sentaient des signes d’un ?tat d?pressif (8 points de plus qu’en 2017), et 12 % avaient eu des pens?es suicidaires. Cons?quence, l’usage des antid?presseurs ne cesse d’augmenter – comme celui des hypnotiques et anxiolytiques. En 2021, 41,4 millions d’ordonnances d’antid?presseurs ont ?t? d?livr?es, soit une augmentation de 5,9 % par rapport ? 2018-2019, avant la crise sanitaire, selon le GIS Epi-Phare (Agence nationale de s?curit? du m?dicament, Assurance-maladie). Au total, en 2021, six millions de Fran?ais ont eu au moins une d?livrance d’antid?presseurs.

Une vari?t? de sympt?mes
Les causes de la d?pression sont multiples, elle survient en g?n?ral apr?s un traumatisme, un stress ou… sans aucun facteur d?clenchant. Pour Jeanne, l’origine est professionnelle, mais la d?pression peut ?galement se manifester apr?s un deuil, un accouchement, une rupture, etc. Il peut exister une pr?disposition g?n?tique. Concr?tement, cette maladie est associ?e ? un d?r?glement de trois neurotransmetteurs – des mol?cules chimiques qui permettent aux neurones de communiquer entre eux –, la s?rotonine, la dopamine et la noradr?naline, impliqu?es dans le comportement et les ?motions. Ce d?s?quilibre provoque une vari?t? de sympt?mes et peut se traduire par une profonde tristesse, une perte d’int?r?t pour les activit?s quotidiennes, une vision pessimiste de soi-m?me mais aussi du monde, des troubles du sommeil, etc. Avec un retentissement majeur sur sa vie et celle de son entourage.

Les repr?sentants de plus de 190 Etats sont r?unis ? Montr?al, au Canada, ? l’occasion de la 15e conf?rence mondiale sur la biodiversit? (COP15). Leur objectif : adopter un nouvel accord global pour arr?ter la destruction de la nature mais aussi attirer l’attention sur ce d?fi majeur, la crise de la biodiversit? demeurant dans l’ombre de la crise climatique. Directrice de la Fondation europ?enne pour le climat, Laurence Tubiana a ?t? l’une des architectes de l’accord de Paris sign? en 2015 et a suivi de pr?s, au cours des derni?res d?cennies, l’avanc?e des discussions sur la biodiversit?.

Pourquoi les n?gociations sur la biodiversit? ont-elles pris du retard sur les n?gociations climatiques ?
Cela tient avant tout aux communaut?s et aux organisations qui ont mis en ?vidence ces questions et ? leur capacit? d’entra?nement. La pr?occupation pour le climat est n?e d’une mobilisation des scientifiques, en particulier am?ricains, qui a donn? lieu ? la cr?ation du GIEC [Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’?volution du climat] d?s 1988. Au moment du sommet de Rio en 1992, o? sont conclus de grands accords internationaux, les scientifiques et les ONG sont d?j? relativement organis?s. Et il y a d?j? une dimension politique forte puisque m?me George Bush p?re participe au sommet et signe la convention sur le climat, qui sera ensuite ratifi?e. Les t?moignages du scientifique James Hansen devant le Congr?s am?ricain ou la mobilisation de jeunes responsables politiques, tels que John Kerry ou Al Gore, ont donn? un ?clairage important ? ce risque climatique.

Ce n’est pas le cas pour la biodiversit? ?
La convention sur la biodiversit? a ?t? promue par des scientifiques mais aussi par les ONG de conservation, et notamment par l’Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature. Celle-ci repr?sente diff?rents points de vue et portait notamment une approche tr?s « conservationniste », celle des naturalistes r?alisant la taxonomie des esp?ces et la description du milieu naturel.";https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2022/12/12/la-cop15-n-a-pas-ete-preparee-pour-aboutir-a-un-accord-de-paris-sur-la-biodiversite_6154050_3244.html
